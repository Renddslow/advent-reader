YHWH saves the people of Israel, his chosen people, from bondage. He brings them out of Egypt, saves them from military incursion, feeds them, and gives them clean water to drink. All of this is done as an act of grace â€“ purely unmerited. The people of Israel have been shown the goodness of YHWH and his great power. They are now given a choice: live as vassals under YHWH's good rule, or go their own way and become just like the other nations.

What follows throughout most of the _Torah_ is God's instruction to his people on how to live as people under his rule. While blessings and curses are associated with keeping or breaking his instruction, they are by no means saved on their own merit. God has already saved them.
