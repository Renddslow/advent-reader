Today begins the Read:Advent journey. Welcome! We'll explore the story of the Bible as it leads to Jesus and then ultimately promises his future coming. We'll be left whispering alongside the Biblical writers, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus."

Our story begins at the birth of the cosmos, with YHWH – Triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit – as its creator. This God orders the cosmos out of chaos, setting each player in it with specific jobs. The sun, moon, and stars are made to govern, and the seas and skies meant to teem with life. And chief among this ordered cosmos are human beings. Their design is after God's own image, royal representatives of God on earth. They are tasked with ruling everything on earth, all under God's definition of right and wrong. 

This element of kingship and rulership is quite important. Watch the notion of kingship as God defines it in Genesis 1 and 2 compared to how it plays out under the auspices of the humans from Genesis 3 through 11. The entire project of goodness which God initiates in the creation and ordering of the cosmos is slowly torn apart by humans ruling the world by their own definition of right and wrong. The only hope to this tragic human story is found in a promise in the middle of Genesis 3: a descendant of the woman – a king – will crush the head of the chaos beast and set things to rights.
