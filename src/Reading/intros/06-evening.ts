Deuteronomy is easily one of the most exciting books in the _Torah_. At first you might be thinking, what? Why? Isn't this just more of the same thing we've gotten before? It starts with a recap of the story so far and then dives right into more laws. But in fact, Deuteronomy is a deeply nuanced look at the civilization of Israel, their worship of God once they enter the promised land, and the important roles of the leaders of the community.

Today's reading in Deuteronomy sets up an important precedent: there will be only one Temple in Israel. This is for one, quite unusual for many ancient cults. But it also sets up several conflicts both in the Hebrew Bible and during the life of Jesus. Pay attention to the importance of the worship of God in the community.
