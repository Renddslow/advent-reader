It's common to expect human deliverers throughout the story of Scripture. We think about Sunday school stories of Joshua, Samson, and David. But what we really see time and again is God delivering his people, often through unconventional means. 

In this morning's readings we'll read about two events which build upon one another to show the people of Israel rebelling against God in the wilderness. But despite their stubbornness, YHWH fights for them. When serpents attack the camp, God provides a means of healing by looking upon the bronze snake that was lifted up. And when a foreign shaman tries to curse the nation of Israel, God compels him to only speak blessing. YHWH uses untraditional symbols – symbols associated with enemies and chaos – to extend grace and blessing.
