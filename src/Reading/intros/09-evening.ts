This morning's readings were difficult to watch. We left the heroes we'd found in Othniel, Ehud, and Deborah and wandered into the corrupt and compromised Gideon, Abimelech, and Jephthah. But this evening, we encounter the pinnacle of compromise in Samson. Samson compounds the violence of Abimelech and Gideon with the _torah_ ignorance of Jephthah. He is arrogant, vindictive, and a total womanizer. This guy is not the Bible's Superman. Samson's downfall is tragic and his epithet proves just how wasted his life truly was.

The book of Judges concludes in even greater tragedy than before, with idolatry, corruption, theft, rape, and civil war. The nation of Israel has become far worse and far more corrupt than the Canaanites they had previous driven out. The writer of Judges pleads alongside the people for a king who would teach the people right from wrong. A king as described in Deuteronomy 17. A king who could be a priest and prophet as well.
