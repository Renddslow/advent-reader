Where yesterday we saw men and women of God rise up to deliver Israel, today we'll see men who become drunk on their authority and power and who don't truly know YHWH. 

In the story of Gideon, we see a young man attempt a strange form of divination to draw out a victory from a God who'd already promised that same victory. Following a miraculous victory, Gideon seizes power, setting up a short-lived dynasty with himself at the forefront. And just as he'd relied on divination to win his victory, he set up an ephod – a sacramental and holy device in the context of the Levitical cult – as yet another form of divination and idolatrous worship. 

In the story of Jephthah, we see a man wholly unfamiliar with the _torah_ of YHWH. First off, Jephthah makes a foolish oath, a thing explicitly warned against. Yet God offers escape from foolish vows (see Leviticus 5). Nevertheless, Jephthah believes that his success is because of a vow and not because of YHWH's faithfulness. And so when the fulfillment of his vow will mean offering his daughter as a burnt offering, he keeps his vow. Yet similar to the foolish vow, this practice is explicitly forbidden. YHWH finds offering humans – especially children – abhorrent.

We see here not only a failure of God's chosen, human deliverers, but a failure of his chosen priests. The priests were tasked with teaching the people to remain faithful to YHWH. If only a priest-deliverer could rise up again like Moses and teach the people.
