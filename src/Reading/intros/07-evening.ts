There's a real poetic symmetry to the end of Deuteronomy in light of the rest of the _Torah_. Like Genesis, it ends with a series of blessings for the children of Israel. Like Leviticus, it ends with a series of covenant curses associated with violating the instructions of God. This section is beautiful in that it is deeply prophetic. It is prophetic in two senses of the word. On one hand, it is prophetic in the classical Biblical sense: calling the people to return to God. On the other, it also lays down a series of future-tellings that will be revealed in the later narratives and in Jesus.

An important thing to pay attention to in these curses is how these curses were most commonly applied to the people in the later narratives due to the failure of priests, prophets, and kings in their capacity as representatives of the people.
