There is much to pay attention to at the close of Genesis. On one hand, there is the story of Joseph, a beautiful novella which sets the stage for many later "faithful Jew" stories like Daniel and Esther. It also demonstrates the faithfulness of YHWH to preserve the covenant made with Abraham and to bless the whole world.

The theme of blessing is important to these chapters. Pay attention to the way the word is used and how it has been used prior to this section throughout the book of Genesis. How does God enact blessing differently from the way the human characters enact blessing? You'll start to see foreshadowing of the blessing promised to the whole world.

You'll also notice that Joseph seems to match many of the characteristic of the snake crusher and the covenant promise made to Abraham. He suffers under evil, but ultimately restores the whole world â€“ giving food during a time of great famine. Perhaps we are seeing the blessing meant for the whole world.
