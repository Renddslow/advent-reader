When we turn the page from Genesis to Exodus we're immediately disappointed to find that Joseph has not come out as the son of woman. The project of restoration hasn't begun. In fact, quite the opposite has occurred. Joseph's legacy of abundance has been completely forgotten, replaced by an oppressive king. The family of Abraham, now called the Hebrews or Israelites are in bondage. 

But YHWH is attentive to the cries of his people. Just as he heard the voice of Abel's blood, the wickedness of the prediluvian world, the oppression of the tower of Babylon, and the harsh treatment of Hagar. Note the role God takes in delivering his people compared to his human agents and to the people he is delivering.
