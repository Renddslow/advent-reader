God promised the woman a son who would conquer the serpent and set the world to rights. God later promised Abraham that this son would come through Abraham's family. The hint we have been given is to pay close attention to the offspring of those connected to Abraham â€“ which is why genealogy is such a common genre throughout the early part of the _Torah_.

Last night we read about Abraham's death. While chronologically his death follows many years after the binding of Isaac in Genesis 22, within the narrative, Abraham all but passes on as a character in the proceeding chapters. The binding of Isaac is Abraham's climax. In that triumphant, yet equally terrible moment, Abraham demonstrated a fidelity and trust in YHWH which had alluded him his entire life. Now, with the saga moved to his son, Isaac, and his grandson, Jacob, we will watch to see if this same fidelity will be passed on.

Jacob takes up a major space of the narrative, and is important to watch. We're presented with a trickster archetype who outwits his enemies and even wrestles with the angel of YHWH and wins. We are left to wonder, will this twisted and troubled anti-hero be the serpent crusher?
