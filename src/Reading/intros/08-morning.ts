In Joshua we see the prototypical Israelite leader â€“ think Deuteronomy 17. He meditates on God's _torah_ day and night, and affirms a life-long commitment to YHWH for himself and his household. It is common to reach for a connection to Jesus in Joshua. Certainly they share a name and a general disposition that it is YHWH who saves. But ultimately, Joshua is a very different kind of leader, and he isn't a deliverer. 

Nevertheless, we see the story progress, with God fighting on behalf of his people, even getting creative when he is put in compromising positions.
