Now I acknowledge that you may feel a bit bogged down at this point. It's your fourth day in a row reading about more instructions for God's covenant people. Why couldn't we skip over this like we had for Numbers? Well for starters, Deuteronomy lays much of the groundwork for what we'll see come out of the people of Israel over the next several narrative books. Many of the instructions given in this book are explicitly ignored and are the source of severe conflict. We also see Jesus quote from Deuteronomy heavily, in fact, the instructions of Deuteronomy are what Jesus combats the Devil with during his temptation in Matthew 4.

As you're reading, pay attention to the rules for prophets, kings, and priests. How are those people meant to serve the nation of Israel, and how are they to be different than the other nations.
