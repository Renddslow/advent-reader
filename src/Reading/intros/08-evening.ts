After Joshua's death, the nation of Israel immediately insulates into their own tribes with various elders and tribal leaders coming to the fore to lead. Joshua's solemn declaration that he and his house will serve YHWH echoes only out into a few generations. Judges begins with the clean up work of Joshua's campaigns with the next generation rising up to take on giants of their own. But quickly the story shifts to a new type of deliverer. 

These deliverers – judges – manage to be relatively godly and upright in this evening's reading, but tomorrow morning we'll see just how morally compromised these people are. Many abuse their God-given – and in one instance supernatural – power to gain wealth, prestige, and more power. This leaves the people wondering if a deliverer will ever come who is like one after God's own heart. What the people hope for is a king.
