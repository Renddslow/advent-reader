Thus, on internal and external grounds, κατῴκισεν is the preferred reading.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to live within us has an envious yearning”?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Interpreters debate the referent of the word “spirit” in this verse: (1) The translation takes “spirit” to be the lustful capacity within people that produces a divided mind (1:8, 14) and inward conflicts regarding God (4:1-4). God has allowed it to be in man since the fall, and he provides his grace (v. 6) and the new birth through the gospel message (1:18-25) to counteract its evil effects. (2) On the other hand the word “spirit” may be taken positively as the Holy Spirit and the sense would be, “God yearns jealously for the Spirit he caused to live within us.” But the word for “envious” or “jealous” is generally negative in biblical usage and the context before and after seems to favor the negative interpretation.sn No OT verse is worded exactly this way. This is either a statement about the general teaching of scripture or a quotation from an ancient translation of the Hebrew text that no longer exists today.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JAS.4.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> But he gives greater grace.
