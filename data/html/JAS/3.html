This was the valley along the south side of Jerusalem. In OT times it was used for human sacrifices to the pagan god Molech (cf. Jer 7:31; 19:5-6; 32:35), and it came to be used as a place where human excrement and rubbish were disposed of and burned. In the intertestamental period, it came to be used symbolically as the place of divine punishment (cf. 1 En. 27:2, 90:26; 4 Ezra 7:36).</span></span></span></span></div>

Externally, the latter reading should be preferred. Internally, however, things get a bit more complex. The notion of being uncontrollable is well suited to the context, especially as a counterbalance to v. 8a, though for this very reason scribes may have been tempted to replace ἀκατάστατον with ἀκατασχετόν. However, in a semantically parallel early Christian text, ἀκατάστατος (akatastato&quot;) was considered strong enough of a term to denounce slander as “a restless demon” (Herm. 27:3). On the other hand, ἀκατάστατον may have been substituted for ἀκατασχετόν by way of assimilation to 1:8 (especially since both words were relatively rare, scribes may have replaced the less familiar with one that was already used in this letter). On internal evidence, it is difficult to decide, though ἀκατασχετόν is slightly preferred. However, in light of the strong support for ἀκατάστατον, and the less-than-decisive internal evidence, ἀκατάστατον is preferred instead.</span></span></span><span class="content"> evil, full of deadly poison. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JAS.3.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> With it we bless the Lord</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Most later mss (Ï), along with several versional witnesses, have θεόν (qeon, “God”) here instead of κύριον (kurion, “Lord”). Such is a predictable variant since nowhere else in the NT is God described as “Lord and Father,” but he is called “God and Father” on several occasions. Further, the reading κύριον is well supported by early and diversified witnesses (Ì20 א A B C P Ψ 33 81 945 1241 1739), rendering it as the overwhelmingly preferred reading.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and Father, and with it we curse people</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “men”; but here ἀνθρώπους (anqrwpous) has generic force, referring to both men and women.</span></span></span><span class="content"> made in God’s image. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="JAS.3.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> From the same mouth come blessing and cursing.
