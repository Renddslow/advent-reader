There is a remarkable concentration of this name of God in this section of Zechariah. Of 53 occurrences of יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת (yÿhvah tsÿva’ot) in the Hebrew text in the book, 18 are in this chapter. The reason is the sheer human impossibility of accomplishing what lies ahead – it must be done by the Lord who rules over all.</span></span></span><span class="content"> came to me as follows: </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ZEC.8.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> “The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all says, ‘I am very much concerned for Zion; indeed, I am so concerned for her that my rage will fall on those who hurt her.’ </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="ZEC.8.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> The Lord says, ‘I have returned to Zion and will live within Jerusalem.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Now Jerusalem will be called “truthful city,” “mountain of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all,” “holy mountain.”’ </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ZEC.8.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Moreover, the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all says, ‘Old men and women will once more live in the plazas of Jerusalem, each one leaning on a cane because of advanced age. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ZEC.8.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The references to longevity and to children living and playing in peace are eschatological in tone.

The founding referred to here is not the initial laying of the temple’s foundations in 536 b.c. (Ezra 3:8) but the resumption of work two years before the time of the present narrative (i.e., in 520 b.c.), as vv. 10-12 make clear.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that the temple might be built. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="ZEC.8.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Before that time there was no compensation for man or animal, nor was there any relief from adversity for those who came and went, because I had pitted everybody – each one – against everyone else. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="ZEC.8.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> But I will be different now to this remnant of my people from the way I was in those days,’ says the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all, </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="ZEC.8.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> ‘for there will be a peaceful time of sowing, the vine will produce its fruit and the ground its yield, and the skies</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the heavens” (so KJV, NAB, NIV).
