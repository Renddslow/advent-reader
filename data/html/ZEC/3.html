Ezra 2:2; 3:2, 8; 4:3; 5:2; 10:18; Neh 7:7; 12:1, 7, 10, 26). He also appears to have been the grandfather of the high priest contemporary with Nehemiah ca. 445 b.c. (Neh 12:10).</span></span></span><span class="content"> standing before the angel of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, with Satan</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew term הַשָּׂטָן (hassatan, “the satan”) suggests not so much a personal name (as in almost all English translations) but an epithet, namely, “the adversary.” This evil being is otherwise thus described in Job 1 and 2 and 1 Chr 21:1. In this last passage the article is dropped and “the satan” becomes “Satan,” a personal name.</span></span></span><span class="content"> standing at his right hand to accuse him. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ZEC.3.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The juxtaposition of the messenger of the Lord in v. 1 and the Lord in v. 2 shows that here, at least, they are one and the same. See Zech 1:11, 12 where they are distinguished from each other.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said to Satan, “May the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> rebuke you, Satan!

He is like a burning stick pulled out of the fire before it is consumed. This is a picture of cleansing, saving grace.</span></span></span><span class="content"> as he stood there before the angel. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ZEC.3.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> The angel</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he”; the referent (the angel, cf. v. 1) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> spoke up to those standing all around, “Remove his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “I have freely forgiven your iniquity and will dress you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The occurrence of the infinitive absolute here for an expected imperfect 1st person common singular (or even imperative 2nd person masculine plural or preterite 3rd person masculine plural) is well-attested elsewhere. Most English translations render this as 1st person singular (“and I will clothe”), but cf. NAB “Take off…and clothe him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in fine clothing.” </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ZEC.3.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Then I spoke up, “Let a clean turban be put on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> stood nearby. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="ZEC.3.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Then the angel of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> exhorted Joshua solemnly: </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="ZEC.3.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> “The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all says, ‘If you live</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “walk,” a frequent biblical metaphor for lifestyle or conduct; TEV “If you [+ truly CEV] obey.” To “walk” in the ways of the Lord is to live life as he intends (cf.

It also suggests the messianic character of the eschatological priesthood in which the priest would have royal prerogatives.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and attend to my courtyards, and I will allow you to come and go among these others who are standing by you. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="ZEC.3.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Listen now, Joshua the high priest, both you and your colleagues who are sitting before you, all of you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “these men.” The cleansing of Joshua and his elevation to enhanced leadership as a priest signify the coming of the messianic age.</span></span></span><span class="content"> are a symbol that I am about to introduce my servant, the Branch.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The collocation of servant and branch gives double significance to the messianic meaning of the passage (cf. Isa 41:8, 9; 42:1, 19; 43:10; 44:1, 2, 21; Ps 132:17; Jer 23:5; 33:15).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="ZEC.3.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> As for the stone</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The stone is also a metaphor for the Messiah, a foundation stone that, at first rejected (Ps 118:22-23; Isa 8:13-15), will become the chief cornerstone of the church (Eph 2:19-22).</span></span></span><span class="content"> I have set before Joshua – on the one stone there are seven eyes.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Some understand the Hebrew term עַיִן (’ayin) here to refer to facets (cf. NAB, NRSV, NLT) or “faces” (NCV, CEV “seven sides”) of the stone rather than some representation of organs of sight.sn The seven eyes are symbolic of divine omniscience and universal dominion (cf. Zech 1:10; 4:10; 2 Chr 16:9).</span></span></span><span class="content"> I am about to engrave an inscription on it,’ says the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all, ‘to the effect that I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Inscriptions were common on ancient Near Eastern cornerstones. This inscription speaks of the redemption achieved by the divine resident of the temple, the Messiah, who will in the day of the Lord bring salvation to all Israel (cf. Isa 66:7-9).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="ZEC.3.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> In that day,’ says the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all, ‘everyone will invite his friend to fellowship under his vine and under his fig tree.’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “under the vine and under the fig tree,” with the Hebrew article used twice as a possessive pronoun (cf. NASB “his”). Some English translations render this as second person rather than third (NRSV “your vine”; cf. also NAB, NCV, TEV).sn The imagery of fellowship under his vine and under his fig tree describes the peaceful dominion of the Lord in the coming messianic age (Mic 4:4; cf. 1 Kgs 4:25).</span></span></span></span></div>
