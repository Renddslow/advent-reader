The prophet, like others before him, probably performed actions dramatizing the account of God’s past dealings with Israel and Judah (cf. Hos 1-3; Isa 20:2-4; Jer 19:1-15; 27:2-11; Ezek 4:1-3).</span></span></span><span class="content"> began to shepherd the flock destined for slaughter, the most afflicted</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc For the MT reading לָכֵן עֲנִיֵּי (lakhen ’aniyyey, “therefore the [most] afflicted of”) the LXX presupposes לִכְנַעֲנֵיּי (“to the merchants of”). The line would then read “So I began to shepherd the flock destined for slaughter for the sheep merchants” (cf. NAB). This helps to explain the difficult לָכֵן (lakhen) here but otherwise has no attestation or justification, so the MT is followed by most modern English versions.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of all the flock.

The “one month” probably means just any short period of time in which three kings ruled in succession. Likely candidates are Elah, Zimri, Tibni (1 Kgs 16:8-20); Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem (2 Kgs 15:8-16); or Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, Zedekiah (2 Kgs 24:1–25:7).</span></span></span><span class="content"> for I ran out of patience with them and, indeed, they detested me as well. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="ZEC.11.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> I then said, “I will not shepherd you.

The Code of Hammurabi prescribes a monthly wage for a laborer of one shekel. If this were the case in Israel, 30 shekels would be the wages for 2 1/2 years (R. de Vaux, Ancient Israel, pp. 76, 204-5). For other examples of “thirty shekels” as a conventional payment, see K. Luke, “The Thirty Pieces of Silver (Zech. 11:12f.), Ind TS 19 (1982): 26-30. Luke, on the basis of Sumerian analogues, suggests that “thirty” came to be a term meaning anything of little or no value (p. 30). In this he follows Erica Reiner, “Thirty Pieces of Silver,” in Essays in Memory of E. A. Speiser, AOS 53, ed. William W. Hallo (New Haven, Conn.: American Oriental Society, 1968), 186-90. Though the 30 shekels elsewhere in the OT may well be taken literally, the context of Zech. 11:12 may indeed support Reiner and Luke in seeing it as a pittance here, not worth considering (cf. Exod 21:32; Lev 27:4; Matt 26:15).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="ZEC.11.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> then said to me, “Throw to the potter that exorbitant sum</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “splendor of splendor” (אֶדֶר הַיְקָר, ’eder hayqar).

The Syriac reading is followed by NAB, NRSV, TEV. Matthew seems to favor this when he speaks of Judas having thrown the thirty shekels for which he betrayed Jesus into the temple treasury (27:5-6). However, careful reading of the whole gospel pericope makes it clear that the money actually was used to purchase a “potter’s field,” hence Zechariah’s reference to a potter. The MT reading is followed by most other English versions.</span></span></span><span class="content"> at the temple</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “house” (so NASB, NIV, NRSV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="ZEC.11.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> Then I cut the second staff “Binders” in two in order to annul the covenant of brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span></span></div>

Zechariah once more is role-playing but this time he is a “foolish” shepherd, i.e., one who does not know God and who is opposed to him (cf. Prov 1:7; 15:5; 20:3; 27:22). The individual who best represents this eschatological enemy of God and his people is the Antichrist (cf. Matt 24:5, 24; 2 Thess 2:3-4; 1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="ZEC.11.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> Indeed, I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not take heed to the sheep headed to slaughter, will not seek the scattered, and will not heal the injured.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the broken” (so KJV, NASB; NRSV “the maimed”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Moreover, he will not nourish the one that is healthy but instead will eat the meat of the fat sheep</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the fat [ones].” Cf.
