The cleft between the two from which the chariots emerge might be related to the eschatological triumph of the Lord who will return to the Mount of Olives and divide it into two mountains, one on the north and the other on the south (cf. Zech 14:1-8; Ezek 47:1-12).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ZEC.6.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Harnessed to the first chariot were red horses, to the second black horses, </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="ZEC.6.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> to the third white horses, and to the fourth spotted horses, all of them strong.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc For the MT reading אֲמֻצִּים (’amutsim, “strong”) Aquila and Syriac presuppose אֲדֻמִּים (’adummim, “red”), thus giving the red horse an assignment and eliminating the problem of a fifth, “spotted” horse. The fourth would be a mottled red horse according to this view. There is, however, no manuscript support for this interpretation.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ZEC.6.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Then I asked the angelic messenger</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on the expression “angelic messenger” in 1:9.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who was speaking with me, “What are these, sir?” </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ZEC.6.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> The messenger replied, “These are the four spirits</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew term translated “spirit” here may also be translated “wind” or “breath” depending on the context (cf.

However, there is also an eschatological dimension, referring to a time when there will be perfect and universal peace.</span></span></span></span></div>

The Hebrew word for “crown” here is עֲטֶרֶת (’ateret), a term never used in the OT for the priestly crown or mitre. Thus, the scene here describes the investing of the priest with royal authority.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and set it on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="ZEC.6.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Then say to him, ‘The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all says, “Look – here is the man whose name is Branch,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The epithet “Branch” (צֶמַח, tsemakh) derives from the verb used here (יִצְמָח, yitsmakh, “will sprout up”) to describe the rise of the Messiah, already referred to in this manner in Zech 3:8 (cf. Isa 11:1; 53:2; Jer 33:15). In the immediate context this refers to Zerubbabel, but the ultimate referent is Jesus (cf. John 19:5).</span></span></span><span class="content"> who will sprout up from his place and build the temple of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="ZEC.6.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> Indeed, he will build the temple of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord,</span></span><span class="content"> and he will be clothed in splendor, sitting as king on his throne.

The notion of the ruler as a priest-king was already apparent in David and his successors (Pss 2:2, 6-8; 110:2, 4), and it finds mature expression in David’s greater Son, Jesus Christ, who will combine both offices in his kingship (Heb 5:1-10; 7:1-25).</span></span></span><span class="content"> with him on his throne and they will see eye to eye on everything. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="ZEC.6.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> The crown will then be turned over to Helem,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn “Helem” is probably the same individual as “Heldai” in v. 10. Since the MT and the major ancient versions leave the apparent conflict unresolved it is probably best to view “Helem” as interchangeable with “Heldai” (cf. “Heled” in 1 Chr 11:30 with “Heleb” [2 Sam 23:29] and “Heldai” [1 Chr 27:15]). A number of modern English versions use “Heldai” here (e.g., NAB, NIV, NRSV, TEV, NLT).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Since the “son of Zephaniah” in v. 10 is Josiah, it might be best here to understand “Hen” in its meaning “grace” (חֵן, khen); that is, “Hen” is a nickname for Josiah – “the gracious one.” A number of modern English translations use “Josiah” here (e.g., NCV, NRSV, NLT).</span></span></span><span class="content"> son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="ZEC.6.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> Then those who are far away</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Those who are far away is probably a reference to later groups of returning exiles under Ezra, Nehemiah, and others.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will come and build the temple of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> so that you may know that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all has sent me to you.
