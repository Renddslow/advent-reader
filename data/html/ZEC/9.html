Most likely “word” (masculine) is the antecedent, i.e., the “word of the Lord” is finding its resting place, that is, its focus in or on Damascus.</span></span></span></span></div>

Thus some propose עָדֵי אָרָם (’ade ’aram, “cities of Aram”; cf. NAB, NRSV) for עֵין אָדָם (’en ’adam, “eye of man”) or אֲדָמָה (’adamah, “ground”) for אָדָם (’adam, “man”), “(surface of) the earth.” It seems best, however, to see “eye” as collective and to understand the passage as saying that the attention of the whole earth will be upon the Lord (cf. NIV, NLT).</span></span></span><span class="content"> especially of the tribes of Israel, are toward the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ZEC.9.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> as are those of Hamath also, which adjoins Damascus, and Tyre</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and Sidon,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see Map1-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</span></span></span><span class="content"> though they consider themselves to be very wise. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="ZEC.9.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Tyre built herself a fortification and piled up silver like dust and gold like the mud of the streets! </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ZEC.9.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Nevertheless the Lord will evict her and shove her fortifications</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew word חַיִל (khayil, “strength, wealth”) can, with certain suffixes, look exactly like חֵל (khel, “fortress, rampart”). The chiastic pattern here suggests that not Tyre’s riches but her defenses will be cast into the sea. Thus the present translation renders the term “fortifications” (so also NLT) rather than “wealth” (NASB, NRSV, TEV) or “power” (NAB, NIV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> into the sea – she will be consumed by fire. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ZEC.9.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Ashkelon will see and be afraid; Gaza will be in great anguish, as will Ekron, for her hope will have been dried up.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The present translation presupposes a Hiphil perfect of יָבֵשׁ (yavesh, “be dry”; cf.

The Messianic king riding into Jerusalem is fully qualified to take the Davidic throne (cf. 1 Sam 23:3; Isa 9:5-6; 11:4; 16:5; Jer 22:1-5; 23:5-6).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and victorious,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew term נוֹשָׁע (nosha’) a Niphal participle of יָשַׁע (yasha’, “to save”) could mean “one delivered” or, if viewed as active, “one bringing salvation” (similar KJV, NIV, NKJV). It is preferable to take the normal passive use of the Niphal and understand that the king, having been delivered, is as a result “victorious” (so also NRSV, TEV, NLT).</span></span></span></span></div>

Matt 21:5; John 12:15), but reference to the universal rule of the king in v. 10 reveals that this is a “split prophecy,” that is, it has a two-stage fulfillment. Verse 9 was fulfilled in Jesus’ earthly ministry but v. 10 awaits a millennial consummation (cf. Rev 19:11-16).</span></span></span><span class="content"> – </span></span></div>
