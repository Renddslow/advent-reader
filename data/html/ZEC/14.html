For other OT and NT references to this aspect of the day of the Lord see Amos 9:8-15; Joel 1:15–2:11; Isa 1:24-31; 2:2-4; 4:2-6; 26:16–27:6; 33:13-24; 59:1–60:22; 65:13-25; Jer 30:7-11; 32:36-44; Ezek 20:33-44; Dan 11:40; 12:1; Matt 24:21, 29; 25:31-46; Rev 19:11-16.</span></span></span><span class="content"> is about to come when your possessions</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “your plunder.” Cf.

Joel 3:12, 15-16; Ezek 38–39; Rev 16:12-21; 19:19-21).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and fight against those nations, just as he fought battles in ancient days.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “as he fights on a day of battle” (similar NASB, NIV, NRSV).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ZEC.14.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives which lies to the east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, leaving a great valley. Half the mountain will move northward and the other half southward.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This seismic activity provides a means of escape from Jerusalem so that the Messiah (the Lord), whose feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, may destroy the wicked nations in the Kidron Valley (the v. of Jehoshaphat, or of “judgment of the Lord”) without harming the inhabitants of the city.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ZEC.14.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Then you will escape</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc For the MT reading נַסְתֶּם (nastem, “you will escape”) the LXX presupposes נִסְתַּם (nistam, “will be stopped up”; this reading is followed by NAB). This appears to derive from a perceived need to eliminate the unexpected “you” as subject. This not only is unnecessary to Hebrew discourse (see “you” in the next clause), but it contradicts the statement in the previous verse that the mountain will be split open, not stopped up.</span></span></span><span class="content"> through my mountain valley, for the mountains will extend to Azal.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Azal is a place otherwise unknown.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Indeed, you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The earthquake in the days of King Uzziah, also mentioned in Amos 1:1, is apparently the one attested to at Hazor in 760 b.c.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Judah.

Besides the fact that cold and ice do not necessarily follow the absence of light, the idea here is that day will be night and night day. The heavenly sources of light “freeze up” as it were, and refuse to shine.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="ZEC.14.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> It will happen in one day (a day known to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">); not in the day or the night, but in the evening there will be light.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn In the evening there will be light. The normal pattern is that light breaks through in the morning (Gen 1:3) but in the day of the Lord in judgment it would do so in the evening. In a sense the universe will be “de-created” in order to be “recreated.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="ZEC.14.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Moreover, on that day living waters will flow out from Jerusalem,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Living waters will flow out from Jerusalem.

Deut 6:4-5). Zechariah, however, universalizes the extent of the Lord’s dominion – he will be “king over all the earth.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="ZEC.14.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> All the land will change and become like the Arabah</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “like a plain” (similar KJV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NRSV, NLT); or “like a steppe”; cf. CEV “flatlands.” The Hebrew term עֲרָבָה (’aravah) refers to an arid plain or steppe, but can be used specifically as the name of the rift valley running from the Sea of Galilee via the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.</span></span></span><span class="content"> from Geba to Rimmon,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The expression from Geba to Rimmon is a way of indicating the extent of all Judah from north (2 Kgs 23:8) to south (Job 15:32; 19:7). Since Geba (Heb. גֶּבַע) means “hill” and Rimmon resembles the word for height (Heb. רָמָה, ramah), this could be a play on words suggesting that all the high country will be made low, like the great Arabah valley.</span></span></span><span class="content"> south of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be raised up and will stay in its own place from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “old gate” (NLT); or “former gate” (NRSV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and on to the Corner Gate,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn From the Benjamin Gate…on to the Corner Gate marks the northern wall of the city of Jerusalem from east to west.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn From the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses indicates the extent of Jerusalem from north to south.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="ZEC.14.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> And people will settle there, and there will no longer be the threat of divine extermination – Jerusalem will dwell in security.</span></span></div>

While this could happen accidentally, the context here favors the idea that Judah is fighting alongside Jerusalem against a common enemy.
