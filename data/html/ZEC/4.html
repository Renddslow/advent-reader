From this basin two pipes extend to each of the seven lamps of the menorah, for a total of fourteen pipes in all. See vv. 11-12.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ZEC.4.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Then I asked the messenger who spoke with me, “What are these,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Here these must refer to the lamps, since the identification of the olive trees is left to vv. 11-14.</span></span></span><span class="content"> sir?” </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ZEC.4.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” So I responded, “No, sir.” </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="ZEC.4.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Therefore he told me, “These signify the word of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by strength and not by power, but by my Spirit,’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn It is premature to understand the Spirit here as the Holy Spirit (the third Person of the Trinity), though the OT prepares the way for that NT revelation (cf. Gen 1:2; Exod 23:3; 31:3; Num 11:17-29; Judg 3:10; 6:34; 2 Kgs 2:9, 15, 16; Ezek 2:2; 3:12; 11:1, 5).</span></span></span><span class="content"> says the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all.”</span></span></div>

TEV “Obstacles as great as mountains”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Because of Zerubbabel you will become a level plain! And he will bring forth the temple</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “temple” has been supplied in the translation to clarify the referent (cf. NLT “final stone of the Temple”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> capstone with shoutings of ‘Grace! Grace!’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Grace is a fitting response to the idea that it was “not by strength and not by power” but by God’s gracious Spirit that the work could be done (cf. v. 6).</span></span></span><span class="content"> because of this.” </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="ZEC.4.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Moreover, the word of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> came to me as follows: </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="ZEC.4.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations of this temple,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “house” (so NAB, NRSV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and his hands will complete it.” Then you will know that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all has sent me to you. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="ZEC.4.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> For who dares make light of small beginnings? These seven eyes</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “these seven.” Eyes are clearly intended in the ellipsis as v. 10b shows. As in 3:9 the idea is God’s omniscience. He who knows the end from the beginning rejoices at the completion of his purposes.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will joyfully look on the tin tablet</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This term is traditionally translated “plumb line” (so NASB, NIV, NLT; cf. KJV, NRSV “plummet”), but it is more likely that the Hebrew בְּדִיל (bÿdil) is to be derived not from בָּדַל (badal), “to divide,” but from a root meaning “tin.” This finds support in the ancient Near Eastern custom of placing inscriptions on tin plates in dedicatory foundation deposits.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in Zerubbabel’s hand.

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="ZEC.4.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> Next I asked the messenger, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the menorah?” </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="ZEC.4.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Before he could reply I asked again, “What are these two extensions</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The usual meaning of the Hebrew term שְׁבֹּלֶת (shÿbolet) is “ears” (as in ears of grain). Here it probably refers to the produce of the olive trees, i.e., olives. Many English versions render the term as “branches,” but cf. NAB “tufts.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the olive trees, which are emptying out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?” </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="ZEC.4.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> He replied, “Don’t you know what these are?” And I said, “No, sir.” </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="ZEC.4.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> So he said, “These are the two anointed ones</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The usual word for “anointed (one),” מָשִׁיַח (mashiakh), is not used here but rather בְנֵי־הַיִּצְהָר (vÿne-hayyitshar), literally, “sons of fresh oil.” This is to maintain consistency with the imagery of olive trees. In the immediate context these two olive trees should be identified with Joshua and Zerubbabel, the priest and the governor. Only the high priest and king were anointed for office in the OT and these two were respectively the descendants of Aaron and David.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”</span></span></div>
