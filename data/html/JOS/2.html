(On the grammatical point, see R. J. Williams, Hebrew Syntax, 42, §235.) In this case Rahab moves the Israelite spies from the hiding place referred to in v. 4 to a safer and less accessible hiding place.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the king’s men tried to find them on the road to the Jordan River</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “River” is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> near the fords.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And the men chased after them [on] the road [leading to] the Jordan to the fords.” The text is written from the perspective of the king’s men.
