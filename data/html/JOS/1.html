The verbal form נְתַתִּיו (nÿtattiv, “I have given it”) is probably a perfect of certitude, emphasizing the certainty of the action. Another option is to translate, “I have already assigned it.” In this case the verb would probably refer to the Lord’s decree to Abraham that he would give this land to his descendants.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JOS.1.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Your territory will extend from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north.

(see HALOT 1:363). The phrase is omitted in the LXX and may be a scribal addition.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and all the way to the Mediterranean Sea</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Great Sea,” the typical designation for the Mediterranean Sea.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the west.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, even to the great sea [at] the place where the sun sets, your territory will be.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JOS.1.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> No one will be able to resist you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “A man will not stand before you.” The second person pronouns in this verse are singular, indicating Joshua is the addressee.</span></span></span><span class="content"> all the days of your life.

Another option is to take the form לִשְׁמֹר as a vocative lamed (ל) with imperative (see Isa 38:20 for an example of this construction), which could be translated, “Indeed, be careful!”</span></span></span><span class="content"> all the law my servant Moses charged you to keep!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “commanded you.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Do not swerve from it to the right or to the left, so that you may be successful</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “be wise,” but the word can mean “be successful” by metonymy.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in all you do.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in all which you go.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JOS.1.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> This law scroll must not leave your lips!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “mouth.”sn This law scroll must not leave your lips.
