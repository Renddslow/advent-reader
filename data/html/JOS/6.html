The Hebrew pronominal suffix “your” is singular, being addressed to Joshua as the leader and representative of the nation. To convey to the modern reader what is about to happen and who is doing it, the translation “I am about to defeat Jericho for you” has been used.</span></span></span><span class="content"> along with its king and its warriors. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JOS.6.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Have all the warriors march around the city one time;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and go around the city, all [you] men of war, encircling the city one time.” The Hebrew verb וְסַבֹּתֶם (vÿsabbotem, “and go around”) is plural, being addressed to the whole army.</span></span></span><span class="content"> do this for six days. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JOS.6.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Have seven priests carry seven rams’ horns</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “rams’ horns, trumpets.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in front of the ark.

The reading in the Hebrew looks like a conflation of variant readings, with the second (“when you hear the sound of the ram’s horn”) being an interpolation that assimilates the text to verse 20 (“when the army heard the sound of the horn”). Note that the words “when you hear the sound of the ram&apos;s horn” do not appear in the LXX of verse 5.</span></span></span><span class="content"> have the whole army give a loud battle cry.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “all the people will shout with a loud shout.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then the city wall will collapse</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “fall in its place.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the warriors should charge straight ahead.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and the people will go up, each man straight ahead.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>

However, the tone seems stronger. Joshua appears to be announcing the certain punishment of the violator. 1 Kgs 16:34, which records the fulfillment of Joshua’s prediction, supports this.
