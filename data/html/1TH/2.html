Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see ExSyn 119-21; M. Zerwick, Biblical Greek, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which God brings is in fact the gospel about himself. This same phrase occurs in vv. 8 and 9 as well.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in spite of much opposition. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="1TH.2.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> For the appeal we make</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “For our exhortation.” Paul here uses παράκλησις (paraklhsis) to speak in broad terms about his preaching of the gospel, in which he urges or appeals to people to respond to God’s salvation (cf. the verb form παρακαλοῦντος [parakalounto&quot;] in 2 Cor 5:20).</span></span></span><span class="content"> does not come</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “[is] not” (the verb “to be” is implied in the Greek construction).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from error or impurity or with deceit, </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="1TH.2.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we declare it, not to please people but God, who examines our hearts. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1TH.2.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> For we never appeared</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “came on the scene,” “came.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed – God is our witness – </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1TH.2.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> nor to seek glory from people, either from you or from others, </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1TH.2.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Punctuating vv. 6 and 7 is difficult. One must consider the difficult textual problem of v. 7 (see tc note on the word “children” in that verse) as well as the grammar of the verse. In the translation above, “little children” is understood to be a predicate nominative connected to the verb “became.” This allows a full stop to be placed at the end of v. 6 and before the phrase “like a nursing mother” in v. 7. This separates the two metaphors which impact the textual problem and allows for greater clarity in the way the sentence is read.</span></span></span><span class="content"> although we could have imposed our weight as apostles of Christ; instead we became</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “were,” “proved to be.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> little children</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The variant ἤπιοι (hpioi, “gentle”) has fair support (א2 A C2 D2 Ψc 0278 33 1739 1881 Ï), but νήπιοι (nhpioi, “little children”) has significantly stronger backing (Ì65 א* B C* D* F G I Ψ* pc it bo). It is not insignificant that the earliest Alexandrian and Western witnesses in support of ἤπιοι are actually not Alexandrian or Western; they are the second correctors of Alexandrian and Western mss. Such correctors generally follow a Byzantine Vorlage. The reading νήπιοι is thus superior externally. Further, νήπιοι is much harder in this context, for Paul mixes his metaphors (“we became little children in your midst…Like a nursing mother…”). Thus, the scribes would naturally alter this reading to the softer ἤπιοι (“we became gentle…”). Paul is not known for his consistency of figures, however (cf., e.g., Gal 4:19); hence, the intrinsic evidence points to νήπιοι as original. On the other hand, it is possible that νήπιοι was caused by dittography with the preceding -μεν (-men). It is even possible that νήπιοι was caused by an error of hearing right from the beginning: The amanuensis could have heard the apostle incorrectly. But such a supposition cuts both ways; further, Paul would no doubt have corrected the reading in the ms before it was sent out. If so, one would surely have expected both earlier witnesses on the side of ἤπιοι and perhaps a few first correctors to have this reading. The reading “little children” thus stands as most probably original. (For an extended discussion of this problem, see J. A. D. Weima, “‘But We Became Infants Among You’: The Case for NHPIOI in 1 Thess 2.7,” NTS 46 [2000]: 547-64; T. B. Sailors, “Wedding Textual and Rhetorical Criticism to Understand the Text of 1 Thessalonians 2.7,” JSNT 80 [2000]: 81-98.)</span></span></span><span class="content"> among you.
