The Greek word translated received is used for accepting instructions passed on as fixed traditions from teacher to follower. Paul speaks in these terms about doctrinal traditions as well as ethical instruction that he passes on to his converts and expects them to keep (cf. 1 Cor 11:2, 23; 15:1-3; Gal 1:9; Phil 4:9; 2 Thess 2:15; 3:6).</span></span></span><span class="content"> you must live and please God (as you are in fact living)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc This parenthetical clause is absent in several later witnesses (D2 Ψ Ï), but it may have been expunged for sounding redundant.

Some take it to mean “wife” (thus, “to take a wife for himself” or “to live with his wife”), but this is less likely. See J. Smith, “1 Thess 4:4 – Breaking the Impasse,” BBR 10 (Fall 2000), who argues that “vessel” in this context is very likely a euphemism for the sexual organs.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in holiness and honor, </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1TH.4.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1TH.4.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “not to transgress against or defraud his brother in the matter,” continuing the sentence of vv. 3-5.</span></span></span><span class="content"> because the Lord is the avenger in all these cases,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “concerning all these things.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> as we also told you earlier and warned you solemnly. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1TH.4.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1TH.4.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “rejecting man.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</span></span></div>

This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: Believers will one day “wake up” out of death. Here the term refers to death, but “sleep” was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term. This word also occurs in vv. 14 and 15.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="1TH.4.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn “we believe that” is understood from the first clause of the verse, which is parallel.

Also Christians are those whose total existence – life and death – is in and through and for Christ (1 Cor 8:6).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="1TH.4.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> For we tell you this by the word of the Lord,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The word of the Lord is a technical expression in OT literature, often referring to a divine prophetic utterance (e.g., Gen 15:1, Isa 1:10, Jonah 1:1). In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as ῥῆμα τοῦ κυρίου (rJhma tou kuriou; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as λόγος τοῦ κυρίου (logo&quot; tou kuriou; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 1:8; 2 Thess 3:1). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said.</span></span></span><span class="content"> that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will surely not go ahead of those who have fallen asleep. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="1TH.4.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Neither noun in this phrase (ἐν φωνῇ ἀρχαγγέλου, ejn fwnh ajrcangelou, “with the voice of the archangel”) has the article in keeping with Apollonius’ Canon. Since ἀρχάγγελος (ajrcangelo&quot;) is most likely monadic, both nouns are translated as definite in keeping with Apollonius’ Corollary (see ExSyn 250-51).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="1TH.4.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> Then we who are alive, who are left,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The words οἱ περιλειπόμενοι (Joi perileipomenoi, “[the ones] who are left”) are lacking in F G {0226vid} ar b as well as a few fathers, but the rest of the textual tradition has the words.
