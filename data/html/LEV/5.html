         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="LEV.5.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> “‘When a person sins</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And a person when he sins.” Most English versions translate this as the protasis of a conditional clause: “if a person sins” (NASB, NIV).sn The same expression occurs in Lev 4:2 where it introduces sins done “by straying unintentionally from any of the commandments of the Lord which must not be done” (see the notes there). Lev 5:1-13 is an additional section of sin offering regulations directed at violations other than those referred to by this expression in Lev 4:2 (see esp. 5:1-6), and expanding on the offering regulations for the common person in Lev 4:27-35 with concessions to the poor common person (5:7-13).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in that he hears a public curse against one who fails to testify</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “against one who fails to testify” are not in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied to make sense of the remark about the “curse” (“imprecation” or “oath”; cf. ASV “adjuration”; NIV “public charge”) for the modern reader. For the interpretation of this verse reflected in the present translation see J. Milgrom, Leviticus (AB), 1:292-97.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and he is a witness (he either saw or knew what had happened</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “what had happened” are not in the Hebrew text, but are implied.</span></span></span><span class="content">) and he does not make it known,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and hears a voice of curse, and he is a witness or he saw or he knew, if he does not declare.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> then he will bear his punishment for iniquity.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he shall bear his iniquity.” The rendering “bear the punishment (for the iniquity)” reflects the use of the word “iniquity” to refer to the punishment for iniquity (cf. NRSV, NLT “subject to punishment”). It is sometimes referred to as the consequential use of the term (cf. Lev 5:17; 7:18; 10:17; etc.).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="LEV.5.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Or when there is</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The insertion of the words “when there is” is a reflection of the few Hebrew mss, Smr, and LXX that have כִּי (ki, “when, if”; cf. vv. 3 and esp. 4) rather than the MT’s אֲשֶׁר (’asher, “who”). Many English versions render this as a conditional clause (“if”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> a person who touches anything ceremonially</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “ceremonially” has been supplied in the translation to clarify that the uncleanness involved is ritual or ceremonial in nature.</span></span></span><span class="content"> unclean, whether the carcass of an unclean wild animal, or the carcass of an unclean domesticated animal, or the carcass of an unclean creeping thing, even if he did not realize it,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and it is hidden from him,” meaning that the person who contracted the ceremonial uncleanness was not aware at the time what had happened, but later found out that he had become ceremonially unclean. This same phrase occurs again in both vv. 3 and 4.</span></span></span><span class="content"> but he himself has become unclean and is guilty;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Lev 5:2-3 are parallel laws of uncleanness (contracted from animals and people, respectively), and both seem to assume that the contraction of uncleanness was originally unknown to the person (vv. 2 and 3) but became known to him or her at a later time (v. 3; i.e., “has come to know” in v. 3 is to be assumed for v. 2 as well). Uncleanness itself did not make a person “guilty” unless he or she failed to handle it according to the normal purification regulations (see, e.g., “wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening,” Lev 15:5 NIV; cf. Lev 11:39-40; 15:5-12, 16-24; Num 19, etc.). The problem here in Lev 5:2-3 is that, because the person had not been aware of his or her uncleanness, he or she had incurred guilt for not carrying out these regular procedures, and it would now be too late for that. Thus, the unclean person needs to bring a sin offering to atone for the contamination caused by his or her neglect of the purity regulations.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="LEV.5.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> or when he touches human uncleanness with regard to anything by which he can become unclean,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “or if he touches uncleanness of mankind to any of his uncleanness which he becomes unclean in it.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> even if he did not realize it, but he himself has later come to know it and is guilty; </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="LEV.5.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> or when a person swears an oath, speaking thoughtlessly</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “to speak thoughtlessly”; cf.

E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 45), with the word “oath” supplied in the translation for clarity. Another possibility is that “to one from these” is a dittography from v. 5 (cf. the note on v. 5a), and that v. 4 ends with “and is guilty” like vv. 2 and 3 (J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:300).</span></span></span><span class="content"> – </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="LEV.5.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> when an individual becomes guilty with regard to one of these things</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and it shall happen when he becomes guilty to one from these,” referring to any of “these” possible transgressions in Lev 5:1-4. Tg. Onq., the original Greek translation, and the Latin Vulgate omit this clause, possibly due to homoioteleuton because of the repetition of “to one from these” from the end of v. 4 in v. 5a (cf. the note on v. 4b).sn What all the transgressions in Lev 5:1-4 have in common is that the time is past for handling the original situation properly (i.e., testifying in court, following purity regulations, or fulfilling an oath), so now the person has become guilty and needs to follow corrective sacrificial procedures.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he must confess how he has sinned,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “which he sinned on it”; cf.

The term translated “animal from the flock” (שֶׂה, seh) is often translated “lamb” (e.g., KJV, NASB, NIV, NCV) or “sheep” (e.g., NRSV, TEV, NLT), but it clearly includes either a sheep or a goat here (cf. v. 6), referring to the smaller pasture animals as opposed to the larger ones (i.e., cattle; cf. 4:3). Some English versions use the more generic “animal” (e.g., NAB, CEV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> he must bring his penalty for guilt for his sin that he has committed,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he shall bring his guilt which he sinned,” which is an abbreviated form of Lev 5:6, “and he shall bring his [penalty for] guilt to the Lord for his sin which he committed.” The words “for his sin” have been left out in v. 7, and “to the Lord” has been moved so that it follows the mention of the birds.</span></span></span><span class="content"> two turtledoves or two young pigeons,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on Lev 1:14 above.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="LEV.5.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> He must bring them to the priest and present first the one that is for a sin offering.

The sin offering deals with violations of “any of the commandments,” whereas the guilt offering focuses specifically on violations of regulations regarding “holy things” (i.e., things that have been consecrated to the Lord; see the full discussion in J.

Others still maintain the view that it refers to the value of the ram that was offered (see, e.g., NIV “of the proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary shekel”; also NAB, NLT; J. E.

It was closely associated with reconsecration of the Lord’s sacred things or his sacred people (see, e.g., Lev 14:12-18; Num 6:11b-12). Moreover, there was usually an associated reparation made for the trespass, including restitution of that which was violated plus one fifth of its value as a fine (Lev 5:16; 6:5 [5:24 HT]). See R. E.

Another possibility is that it refers to a situation where a person suspects that he violated something although he does not recollect it.
