Lev 19:37; 20:22; 25:18; 26:46). Note especially the thematic and formulaic relationships between the introduction here in Lev 18:1-5 and the paraenesis in Lev 20:22-26, both of which refer explicitly to the corrupt nations and the need to separate from them by keeping the Lord’s regulations.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and you must be sure to walk in my statutes.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and my statutes you shall keep [or “watch; guard”] to walk in them.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> I am the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="LEV.18.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> So you must keep</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And you shall keep.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> my statutes and my regulations; anyone who does so will live by keeping them.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “which the man shall do them and shall live in them.” The term for “a man, human being; mankind” (אָדָם, ’adam; see the note on Lev 1:2) in this case refers to any person among “mankind,” male or female.

Lev 15:2). The two words for “flesh” are combined to refer to emphasize the physical familial relatedness (see J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 282, and B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 119).</span></span></span><span class="content"> to have sexual intercourse with her.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “to uncover [her] nakedness” (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), which is clearly euphemistic for sexual intercourse (see J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 282, and B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 119). This expression occurs a number of times in the following context and is generally translated “have sexual intercourse with [someone],” although in the case of the father mentioned in the following verse the expression may be connected to the shame or disgrace that would belong to the father whose wife’s sexuality is violated by his son. See the note on the word “mother” in v. 7.</span></span></span><span class="content"> I am the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The general statement prohibiting sexual intercourse between close relatives serves as an opening summary statement for the following section, which gives details concerning which degrees of relationship are specifically forbidden.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="LEV.18.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> You must not</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verbal negative here is the same as that used in the Ten Commandments (Exod 20:4-5, 7, 13-17).

A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 120, and J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 294). The expression may, however, derive from the shame of nakedness when exposed. If one exposes his mother’s nakedness to himself it is like openly exposing the father’s nakedness (cf. Gen 9:22-23 with the background of Gen 2:25 and 3:7, 21). The same essential construction is used in v. 10 where the latter explanation makes more sense than the former.</span></span></span><span class="content"> She is your mother; you must not have intercourse with her. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="LEV.18.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> You must not have sexual intercourse with your father’s wife; she is your father’s nakedness.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the nakedness of your father she is.” See the note on v. 7 above.

Recent English versions differ on how they handle this: NAB “would be shameful”; CEV “would make you unclean”; NIV “wickedness”; NLT “horrible wickedness”; NRSV “depravity”; TEV “incest.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="LEV.18.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> You must not take a woman in marriage and then marry her sister as a rival wife</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “as a concubine”; Heb “And a woman to her sister you shall not take to be a second wife [or “to be a concubine”].” According to HALOT 1059 s.v.

It could refer to either human sacrifice or a devotion of children to some sort of service of Molech, perhaps of a sexual sort (cf. Lev 20:2-5; 2 Kgs 23:10, etc.). The inclusion of this prohibition against Molech worship here may be due to some sexual connection of this kind, or perhaps simply to the lexical link between זֶרַע (zera’) meaning “seed, semen” in v. 20 but “offspring” in v. 21.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that you do not profane</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and you shall not profane.” Regarding “profane,” see the note on Lev 10:10 above.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the name of your God.
