It is sometimes related to I רָכַל (“to go about as a trader [or “merchant”]”; BDB 940 s.v. רָכַל), and taken to refer to cutthroat business dealings, but there may be a II רָכַל, the meaning of which is dubious (HALOT 1237 s.v.

Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 129-30, and J. E.

If there is a distinction, the construction here probably calls for direct and helpful action toward one’s neighbor (see the discussion in J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 305, and esp. 317-18). Such love stands in contrast to taking vengeance or bearing a grudge against someone and, in NT terms, amounts to fulfilling the so-called “golden rule” (Matt 7:12).</span></span></span><span class="content"> I am the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="LEV.19.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content"> You must keep my statutes.
