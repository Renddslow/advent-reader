The same term is used for “flawed” animals, which must not be offered to the Lord in Lev 22:20-25.</span></span></span><span class="content"> is to approach to present the food of his God. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="LEV.21.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> Certainly</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The particle כִּי (ki) in this context is asseverative, indicating absolutely certainty (GKC 498 §159.ee).</span></span></span><span class="content"> no man who has a physical flaw is to approach: a blind man, or one who is lame, or one with a slit nose,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Lexically, the Hebrew term חָרֻם (kharum) seems to refer to a split nose or perhaps any number of other facial defects (HALOT 354 s.v.

KJV, ASV “a flat nose”; NASB “a disfigured face.” The NJPS translation is “a limb too short” as a balance to the following term which means “extended, raised,” and apparently refers to “a limb too long” (see the explanation in B.

See HALOT 386 s.v. יָד and 1184 s.v. רֶגֶל respectively (cf. the NJPS translation). In this context, these terms probably apply to any part of the limb that was broken, including hand and the foot. B. A. Levine (Leviticus [JPSTC], 146) points out that such injuries often did not heal properly in antiquity because they were not properly set and, therefore, remained a “physical flaw” permanently.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="LEV.21.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content"> or a hunchback, or a dwarf,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “thin”; cf.
