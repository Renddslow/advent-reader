In this case, however, the blood manipulation is different because Moses, not Aaron (and his sons), is functioning as the priest. On the one hand, Aaron and his sons are, in a sense, treated as if they were commoners so that the blood manipulation took place at the burnt offering altar in the court of the tabernacle (see v. 15 below), not at the incense altar inside the tabernacle tent itself (contrast Lev 4:5-7 and compare 4:30). On the other hand, since it was a sin offering for the priests, therefore, the priests themselves could not eat its flesh (Lev 4:11-12; 6:30 [23 HT]), which was the normal priestly practice for sin offerings of commoners (Lev 6:26[19], 29[22]).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the sin offering bull, </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="LEV.8.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> and he slaughtered it.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Contrary to some English versions (e.g., NAB, NASB, NIV, NLT), Aaron (not Moses) most likely slaughtered the bull, possibly with the help of his sons, although the verb is singular, not plural. Moses then performed the ritual procedures that involved direct contact with the altar. Compare the pattern in Lev 1:5-9, where the offerer does the slaughtering and the priests perform the procedures that involve direct contact with the altar. In Lev 8 Moses is functioning as the priest in order to consecrate the priesthood. The explicit reintroduction of the name of Moses as the subject of the next verb seems to reinforce this understanding of the passage (cf. also vv. 19 and 23 below).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Moses then took the blood and put it all around on the horns of the altar with his finger and decontaminated the altar,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is the Piel of חָטָא (khata’, “to sin”) and means “to de-sin” the altar.

Some derive the terminology from the procedure in Lev 8:27-28, but the term for “hands” there is actually “palms.” It seems more likely that it derives from the notion of putting the priestly responsibilities (or possibly its associated prebends) under their control (i.e., “filling their hands” with authority; see J.

The command “to keep the charge of the Lord” in v. 35 and the expression “by the hand of Moses” (i.e., under the authoritative hand of Moses, v. 36) may also support this interpretation.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="LEV.8.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content"> What has been done</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “just as he has done” (cf. the note on v. 33).</span></span></span><span class="content"> on this day the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has commanded to be done</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord has commanded to do” (cf. the note on v. 33).</span></span></span><span class="content"> to make atonement for you. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="LEV.8.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content"> You must reside at the entrance of the Meeting Tent day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> so that you will not die, for this is what I have been commanded.” </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="LEV.8.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content"> So Aaron and his sons did all the things the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> had commanded through</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “by the hand of” (so KJV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Moses.</span></span></div>
