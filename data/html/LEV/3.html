This was illustrated by the fact that the fat parts of the animal were consumed on the altar of the Lord but the meat was consumed by the worshipers in a meal before God. This is the only kind of offering in which common worshipers partook of the meat of the animal. When there was a series of offerings that included a peace offering (see, e.g., Lev 9:8-21, sin offerings, burnt offerings, and afterward the peace offerings in vv. 18-21), the peace offering was always offered last because it expressed the fact that all was well between God and his worshiper(s). There were various kinds of peace offerings, depending on the worship intended on the specific occasion. The “thank offering” expressed thanksgiving (e.g., Lev 7:11-15; 22:29-30), the “votive offering” fulfilled a vow (e.g., Lev 7:16-18; 22:21-25), and the “freewill offering” was offered as an expression of devotion and praise to God (e.g., Lev 7:16-18; 22:21-25). The so-called “ordination offering” was also a kind of peace offering that was used to consecrate the priests at their ordination (e.g., Exod 29:19-34; Lev 7:37; 8:22-32). See R. E. Averbeck, NIDOTTE 1:1066-73 and 4:135-43.</span></span></span><span class="content"> if he presents an offering from the herd, he must present before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> a flawless male or a female.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “if a male if a female, perfect he shall present it before the Lord.” The “or” in the present translation (and most other English versions) is not present in the Hebrew text here, but see v. 6 below.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="LEV.3.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> He must lay his hand on the head of his offering and slaughter it at the entrance of the Meeting Tent, and the sons of Aaron, the priests, must splash the blood against the altar’s sides.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the remarks on Lev 1:3-5 above for some of the details of translation here.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="LEV.3.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Then the one presenting the offering</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Then he”; the referent (the person presenting the offering) has been specified in the translation for clarity (cf. the note on Lev 1:5).</span></span></span><span class="content"> must present a gift to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> from the peace offering sacrifice: He must remove the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that surrounds the entrails,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and all the fat on the entrails.” The fat layer that covers the entrails as a whole (i.e., “that covers the entrails”) is different from the fat that surrounds and adheres to the various organs (“on the entrails,” i.e., surrounding them; J.
