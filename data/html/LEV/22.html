NAB, NRSV “in fulfillment of a vow”) or, alternatively, “to make a vow” or “for making a vow” (HALOT 928 s.v. פלא piel [II פלא]). Perhaps it refers to the making a special vow, from the verb פָלַא (pala’, “to be wonderful, to be remarkable”); cf. J. Milgrom, Numbers (JPSTC), 44. B. A. Levine, Leviticus (JPSTC), 151 and 193, suggests that this is a special term for “setting aside a votive offering” (related to פָלָה [palah, “to set aside”]). In general, the point of the expression seems to be that this sacrifice arises as a special gift to God out of special circumstances in the life of the worshiper.</span></span></span><span class="content"> or for a freewill offering from the herd or the flock, it must be flawless to be acceptable;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “for acceptance”; NAB “if it is to find acceptance.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> it must have no flaw.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “all/any flaw shall not be in it.”</span></span></span></span></div>
