Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 118) as do a few English versions (e.g., NAB), but others argue that, as on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16), the offerings of the priests also effected the people, even though there was still the need to have special offerings made on behalf of the people as reflected in the second half of the verse (e.g., B.

The distinction between this verb and “presented” in v. 9 above (see the note there) is that in v. 9 Aaron’s sons held the bowl while Aaron manipulated some of the blood at the altar, while here in v. 12 they simply handed the bowl to him so he could splash all the blood around on the altar (Milgrom, 581).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the blood to him and he splashed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn For “splashed” (also in v. 18) see the note on Lev 1:5.</span></span></span><span class="content"> it against the altar’s sides. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="LEV.9.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> The burnt offering itself they handed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on v. 12.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to him by its parts, including the head,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and the burnt offering they handed to him to its parts and the head.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and he offered them up in smoke on the altar, </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="LEV.9.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> and he washed the entrails and the legs and offered them up in smoke on top of the burnt offering on the altar. </span></span></div>

The regulations for it were appended to the end of the section of priestly consecration regulations in Exod 29 (see Exod 29:38-40) precisely because they were to be maintained throughout the priestly consecration period and beyond (Lev 8:33-36). Thus, the morning burnt and grain offerings would already have been placed on the altar before the inaugural burnt and grain offerings referred to here.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="LEV.9.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram – the peace offering sacrifices which were for the people – and Aaron’s sons handed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on Lev 9:12.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the blood to him and he splashed it against the altar’s sides. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="LEV.9.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content"> As for the fat parts from the ox and from the ram</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And the fat from the ox and from the ram.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> (the fatty tail, the fat covering the entrails,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The text here has only the participle “the cover” or “that which covers,” which is elliptical for “the fat which covers the entrails” (see Lev 3:3, 9, 14; 7:3).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the kidneys, and the protruding lobe of the liver), </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="LEV.9.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content"> they</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The plural “they” refers to the sons of Aaron (cf. v. 18).
