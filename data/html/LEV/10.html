The tragic incident in Lev 10 happened in close temporal connection to the Lord’s fire that consumed the offerings at the end of Lev 9. Thus, for example, the “sin offering” male goat referred to in Lev 10:16-19 is the very one referred to in Lev 9:15.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Aaron’s sons, Nadab and Abihu, each took his fire pan and put fire in it, set incense on it, and presented strange fire</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The expression “strange fire” (אֵשׁ זָרָה, ’esh zarah) seems imprecise (cf. NAB “profane fire”; NIV “unauthorized fire”; NRSV “unholy fire”; NLT “a different kind of fire”) and has been interpreted numerous ways (see the helpful summary in J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 132-33). The infraction may have involved any of the following or a combination thereof: (1) using coals from someplace other than the burnt offering altar (i.e., “unauthorized coals” according to J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:598; cf. Lev 16:12 and cf. “unauthorized person” אִישׁ זָר (’ish zar) in Num 16:40 [17:5 HT], NASB “layman”), (2) using the wrong kind of incense (cf. the Exod 30:9 regulation against “strange incense” קְטֹרֶת זָרָה (qÿtoreh zarah) on the incense altar and the possible connection to Exod 30:34-38), (3) performing an incense offering at an unprescribed time (B. A. Levine, Leviticus [JPSTC], 59), or (4) entering the Holy of Holies at an inappropriate time (Lev 16:1-2).</span></span></span><span class="content"> before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, which he had not commanded them to do. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="LEV.10.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> So fire went out from the presence of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on 9:24a.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and consumed them so that they died before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="LEV.10.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> spoke: ‘Among the ones close to me I will show myself holy,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Niphal verb of the Hebrew root קָדַשׁ (qadash) can mean either “to be treated as holy” (so here, e.g., BDB 873 s.v. קָּדַשׁ, LXX, NASB, and NEB) or “to show oneself holy” (so here, e.g., HALOT 1073 s.v. קדשׁnif.1, NIV, NRSV, NLT; J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:595, 601-3; and J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 133-34). The latter rendering seems more likely here since, in the immediate context, the Lord himself had indeed shown himself to be holy by the way he responded to the illegitimate incense offering of Nadab and Abihu. They had not treated the Lord as holy, so the Lord acted on his own behalf to show that he was indeed holy.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and in the presence of all the people I will be honored.’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn In this context the Niphal of the Hebrew root כָּבֵד (kaved) can mean “to be honored” (e.g., NASB and NIV here), “be glorified” (ASV, NRSV and NLT here), or “glorify oneself, show one’s glory” (cf. NAB; e.g., specifically in this verse HALOT 455 s.v. כבדnif.3; J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB], 1:595, 603-4; and J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 126, 134). Comparing this clause with the previous one (see the note above), the point may be that when the Lord shows himself to be holy as he has done in 10:1-2, this results in him being honored (i.e., reverenced, feared, treated with respect) among the people. This suggests the passive rendering. It is possible, however, that one should use the reflexive rendering here as in the previous clause. If so, the passage means that the Lord showed both his holiness and his glory in one outbreak against Nadab and Abihu.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So Aaron kept silent. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="LEV.10.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Moses then called to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron’s uncle, and said to them, “Come near, carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.” </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="LEV.10.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> So they came near and carried them away in their tunics to a place outside the camp just as Moses had spoken. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="LEV.10.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Then Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his other two sons, “Do not</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Smr has “you must not” (לֹא, lo’) rather than the MT’s “do not” (אַל, ’al; cf. the following negative לֹא, lo’, in the MT).</span></span></span><span class="content"> dishevel the hair of your heads</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “do not let free your heads.” Some have taken this to mean, “do not take off your headgear” (cf.

It is a pivot clause, as it were. Thus, it was a “perpetual statute” to not drink alcoholic beverages when ministering in the tabernacle, but it was also a “perpetual statue” to distinguish between holy and profane and unclean and clean (v. 10) as well as to teach the children of Israel all such statutes (v. 11).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="LEV.10.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> as well as</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and,” but regarding the translation “as well as,” see the note at the end of v. 9.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The two pairs of categories in this verse refer to: (1) the status of a person, place, thing, or time – “holy” (קֹדֶשׁ, qodesh) versus “common” (חֹל, khol); as opposed to (2) the condition of a person, place, or thing – “unclean” (טָמֵא, tame’) versus “clean” (טָהוֹר, tahor). Someone or something could gain “holy” status by being “consecrated” (i.e., made holy; e.g., the Hebrew Piel קִדֵּשׁ (qiddesh) in Lev 8:15, 30), and to treat someone or something that was holy as if it were “common” would be to “profane” that person or thing (the Hebrew Piel הִלֵּל [hillel], e.g., in Lev 19:29 and 22:15). Similarly, on another level, someone or something could be in a “clean” condition, but one could “defile” (the Hebrew Piel טִמֵּא [timme’], e.g., in Gen 34:5 and Num 6:9) that person or thing and thereby make it “unclean.” To “purify” (the Hebrew Piel טִהֵר [tiher], e.g., in Lev 16:19 and Num 8:6, 15) that unclean person or thing would be to make it “clean” once again. With regard to the animals (Lev 11), some were by nature “unclean,” so they could never be eaten, but others were by nature “clean” and, therefore, edible (Lev 11:2, 46-47). The meat of clean animals could become inedible by too long of a delay in eating it, in which case the Hebrew term פִּגּוּל (pigul) “foul, spoiled” is used to describe it (Lev 7:18; 19:7; cf. also Ezek 4:14 and Isa 65:4), not the term for “unclean” (טָהוֹר, tahor). Strictly speaking, therefore, unclean meat never becomes clean, and clean meat never becomes unclean.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="LEV.10.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> and to teach the Israelites all the statutes that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has spoken to them through</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “by the hand of” (so KJV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Moses.” </span></span></div>

Such a notion is, however, found nowhere else in the Levitical regulations and seems unlikely (so J. E. Hartley, Leviticus [WBC], 136). A more likely interpretation is reflected in this interpretive rendering: “he gave it to you [as payment] for [your work of] bearing the iniquity of the congregation.” The previous section of the chapter deals with the prebends that the priests received for performing the ministry of the tabernacle (Lev 10:12-15).
