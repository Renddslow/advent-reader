The term is well attested in both LXX (Gen 40:13, 21; 41:13) and intertestamental Jewish literature (2 Macc 4:10, 50) as meaning “ruler, authority” (BDAG 138 s.v. 6). Some have connected this passage to Paul’s statements in Col 1:15, 18 which describe Christ as ἀρχή and πρωτότοκος (prwtotoko&quot;; e.g., see R. H. Mounce, Revelation [NICNT], 124) but the term ἀρχή has been understood as either “beginning” or “ruler” in that passage as well. The most compelling connection is to be found in the prologue to John’s Gospel (1:2-4) where the λόγος (logos) is said to be “in the beginning (ἀρχή) with God,” a temporal reference connected with creation, and then v. 3 states that “all things were made through him.” The connection with the original creation suggests the meaning “originator” for ἀρχή here. BDAG 138 s.v. 3 gives the meaning “the first cause” for the word in Rev 3:14, a term that is too philosophical for the general reader, so the translation “originator” was used instead. BDAG also notes, “but the mng. beginning = ‘first created’ is linguistically probable (s. above 1b and Job 40:19; also CBurney, Christ as the ᾿Αρχή of Creation: JTS 27, 1926, 160-77).” Such a meaning is unlikely here, however, since the connections described above are much more probable.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of God’s creation: </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="REV.3.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Laodicea was near two other towns, each of which had a unique water source. To the north was Hierapolis which had a natural hot spring, often used for medicinal purposes. To the east was Colossae which had cold, pure waters. In contrast to these towns, Laodicea had no permanent supply of good water. Efforts to pipe water to the city from nearby springs were successful, but it would arrive lukewarm. The metaphor in the text is not meant to relate spiritual fervor to temperature. This would mean that Laodicea would be commended for being spiritually cold, but it is unlikely that Jesus would commend this. Instead, the metaphor condemns Laodicea for not providing spiritual healing (being hot) or spiritual refreshment (being cold) to those around them. It is a condemnation of their lack of works and lack of witness.</span></span></span><span class="content"> I wish you were either cold or hot! </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="REV.3.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “I intend.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to vomit</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This is the literal meaning of the Greek verb ἐμέω (emew).
