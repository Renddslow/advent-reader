Zerwick’s “general” genitive [Biblical Greek, §§36-39]; D. B. Wallace’s “plenary” genitive [ExSyn 119-21]). In 1:1 and 22:16 it is clear that Jesus has sent his angel to proclaim the message to John; thus the message is from Christ, and this would be a subjective genitive. On a broader scale, though, the revelation is about Christ, so this would be an objective genitive. One important point to note is that the phrase under consideration is best regarded as the title of the book and therefore refers to the whole of the work in all its aspects. This fact favors considering this as a plenary genitive.</span></span></span><span class="content"> which God gave him to show his servants</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “slaves.” Although this translation frequently renders δοῦλος (doulos) as “slave,” the connotation is often of one who has sold himself into slavery; in a spiritual sense, the idea is that of becoming a slave of God or of Jesus Christ voluntarily. The voluntary notion is not conspicuous here; hence, the translation “servants.” In any case, the word does not bear the connotation of a free individual serving another. BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.</span></span></span><span class="content"> what must happen very soon.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 992-93 s.v. τάχος has “quickly, at once, without delay Ac 10:33 D; 12:7; 17:15 D; 22:18; 1 Cl 48:1; 63:4…soon, in a short time…Rv 1:1; 22:6…shortly Ac 25:4.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> He made it clear</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “He indicated it clearly” (L&amp;N 33.153).</span></span></span><span class="content"> by sending his angel to his servant</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on the word “servants” earlier in this verse.</span></span></span><span class="content"> John, </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="REV.1.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> who then</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn “Then” is not in the Greek text, but is supplied to make the chronological succession clear in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> testified to everything that he saw concerning the word of God and the testimony about</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The genitive phrase “about Jesus Christ” is taken as an objective genitive.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Jesus Christ. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="REV.1.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Blessed is the one who reads the words of this</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “this” is used to translate the Greek article τῆς (ths), bringing out its demonstrative force.</span></span></span><span class="content"> prophecy aloud,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “aloud” has been supplied to indicate that in the original historical setting reading would usually refer to reading out loud in public rather than silently to oneself.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and blessed are</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “blessed are” are repeated from the beginning of this verse for stylistic reasons and for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> those who hear and obey</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “keep.” L&amp;N 36.19 has “to continue to obey orders or commandments – ‘to obey, to keep commandments, obedience.’”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the things written in it, because the time is near!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The time refers to the time when the things prophesied would happen.</span></span></span></span></div>

Its inclusion, as supported by the bulk of the Byzantine witnesses, is clearly secondary and a scribal attempt to achieve two things: (1) to make explicit the referent in the passage, namely, God, and (2) to smooth out the grammar. The preposition “from” in Greek required a noun in the genitive case. But here in Rev 1:4 the words following the preposition “from” (ἀπό) are in another case, i.e., the nominative. There are two principal ways in which to deal with this grammatical anomaly. First, it could be a mistake arising from someone who just did not know Greek very well, or as a Jew, was heavily influenced by a Semitic form of Greek. Both of these unintentional errors are unlikely here. Commenting on this ExSyn 63 argues: “Either of these is doubtful here because (1) such a flagrant misunderstanding of the rudiments of Greek would almost surely mean that the author could not compose in Greek, yet the Apocalypse itself argues against this; (2) nowhere else does the Seer [i.e., John] use a nom. immediately after a preposition (in fact, he uses ἀπό 32 times with the gen. immediately following).” The passage appears to be an allusion to Exod 3:14 (in the LXX) where God refers to himself as “he who is” (ὁ ὤν), the same wording in Greek as here in Rev 1:4. Thus, it appears that John is wanting to leave the divine name untouched (perhaps to allude to God’s immutability, or as a pointer to the Old Testament as the key to unlocking the meaning of this book), irrespective of what it “looks” like grammatically. The translation has placed the “he who is” in quotation marks to indicate to the reader that the syntactical awkwardness is intentional. (For further comments, see ExSyn 63).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and who was, and who is still to come,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 106 s.v. ἀπό 5.d states: “The expr. εἰρήνη ἀπὸ ‘ὁ ὢν καὶ ὁ ἦν καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος’ Rv 1:4 is quite extraordinary.

In the present translation, however, ὁ πιστός was taken as an adjective in attributive position to ὁ μάρτυς. The idea of martyrdom and faithfulness are intimately connected. See BDAG 820 s.v. πιστός 1.a.α: “ὁ μάρτυς μου ὁ πιστός μου Rv 2:13 (μάρτυς 3); in this ‘book of martyrs’ Christ is ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστὸς (καὶ ὁ ἀληθινός) 1:5; 3:14; cp. 19:11 (the combination of ἀληθινός and πιστός in the last two passages is like 3 Macc 2:11).

Internally, it seems that the reading “washed” could have arisen in at least one of three ways: (1) as an error of hearing (both “released” and “washed” are pronounced similarly in Greek); (2) an error of sight (both “released” and “washed” look very similar – a difference of only one letter – which could have resulted in a simple error during the copying of a ms); (3) through scribal inability to appreciate that the Hebrew preposition ב can be used with a noun to indicate the price paid for something. Since the author of Revelation is influenced significantly by a Semitic form of Greek (e.g., 13:10), and since the Hebrew preposition “in” (ב) can indicate the price paid for something, and is often translated with the preposition “in” (ἐν, en) in the LXX, the author may have tried to communicate by the use of ἐν the idea of a price paid for something. That is, John was trying to say that Christ delivered us at the price of his own blood. This whole process, however, may have been lost on a later scribe, who being unfamiliar with Hebrew, found the expression “delivered in his blood” too difficult, and noticing the obvious similarities between λύσαντι and λούσαντι, assumed an error and then proceeded to change the text to “washed in his blood” – a thought more tolerable in his mind. Both readings, of course, are true to scripture; the current question is what the author wrote in this verse.tn Or “and released us” (L&amp;N 37.127).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from our sins at the cost of</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The style here is somewhat Semitic, with the use of the ἐν (en) + the dative to mean “at the price of.” The addition of “own” in the English is stylistic and is an attempt to bring out the personal nature of the statement and the sacrificial aspect of Jesus’ death – a frequent refrain in the Apocalypse.</span></span></span><span class="content"> his own blood </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="REV.1.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> and has appointed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb ποιέω (poiew) can indicate appointment or assignment rather than simply “make” or “do.” See Mark 3:14 (L&amp;N 37.106).</span></span></span><span class="content"> us as a kingdom,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See BDAG 168 s.v. βασιλεία 1.a for the idea of “he made us a kingdom,” which was translated as “he appointed us (to be or function) as a kingdom” (see the note on the word “appointed” earlier in the verse).</span></span></span><span class="content"> as priests</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “a kingdom, priests.” The term ἱερεῖς (Jiereis) is either in apposition to βασιλείαν (basileian) or as a second complement to the object “us” (ἡμᾶς, Jhmas).

The author uses the longer expression (εἰς [τοὺς] αἰῶνας [τῶν] αἰώνων, ei&quot; [tou&quot;] aiwna&quot; [twn] aiwnwn) in every other instance of αἰών in Revelation, twelve passages in all (1:18; 4:9, 10; 5:13; 7:12; 10:6; 11:15; 14:11; 15:7; 19:3; 20:10; 22:5). Thus, on the one hand, the style of the author is consistent, while on the other hand, the scribes may have been familiar with such a stylistic feature, causing them to add the words here. The issues are more complex than can be presented here; the longer reading, however, is probably original (the shorter reading arising from accidental omission of the genitive phrase due to similarity with the preceding words).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Amen.</span></span></div>
