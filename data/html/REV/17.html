The translation is a rendering of πορνείας αὐτῆς, found in {A 1006 2344 al}. It seems that the first reading “sexuality immorality on/of the earth” was a scribal mistake in which letters may have been confused (auths would have been read as thsghs), or was perhaps influenced by the presence of “of the world” (τῆς γῆς) at the end of v. 5. The original wording seems to be “her sexual immorality”; codex א has conflated the two readings.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="REV.17.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> On</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has not been translated because of differences between Greek and English style.</span></span></span><span class="content"> her forehead was written a name, a mystery:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Some translations consider the word μυστήριον (musthrion, “mystery”) a part of the name written (“Mystery Babylon the Great,” so KJV, NIV), but the gender of both ὄνομα (onoma, “name”) and μυστήριον are neuter, while the gender of “Babylon” is feminine.
