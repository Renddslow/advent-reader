The particle ὡς is used in Greek generally for comparison, and in Revelation it is used often to describe the appearance of what the author saw. This phrase does not imply that the Lamb “appeared to have been killed” but in reality was not, because the wider context of the NT shows that in fact the Lamb, i.e., Jesus, was killed.

It may have been accidentally added due to its repeated presence in the immediately preceding phrases, or it may have been intentionally added to maintain the symmetry of the phrases or more likely to harmonize the phrase with 1:4; 3:1; 4:5. Or it may have been accidentally deleted by way of homoioteleuton (τὰ ἑπτά, ta Jepta). A decision is difficult in this instance. NA27 also does not find the problem easy to solve, placing the word in brackets to indicate doubts as to its authenticity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> spirits of God</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn See the note on the phrase the seven spirits of God in Rev 4:5.</span></span></span><span class="content"> sent out into all the earth. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="REV.5.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> Then</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “then” to indicate the implied sequence of events within the vision.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he came and took the scroll</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “the scroll” are not in the Greek text, but are implied.

Both readings have excellent support. On the one hand, the present tense seems to be the harder reading in this context. On the other hand, codex A elsewhere mistakes the future for the present (20:6). Further, the lunar sigma in uncial script could have been overlooked by some scribes, resulting in the present tense.
