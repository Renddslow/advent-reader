Thus, the majority of mss make the narrator, rather than the dragon of 12:17, the subject of the verb. The first person reading is most likely an assimilation to the following verb in 13:1, “I saw.” The reading “I stood” was introduced either by accident or to produce a smoother flow, giving the narrator a vantage point on the sea’s edge from which to observe the beast rising out of the sea in 13:1. But almost everywhere else in the book, the phrase καὶ εἶδον (kai eidon, “and I saw”) marks a transition to a new vision, without reference to the narrator’s activity. On both external and internal grounds, it is best to adopt the third person reading, “he stood.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> on the sand</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “sandy beach” (L&amp;N 1.64).</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the seashore.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The standard critical texts of the Greek NT, NA27 and UBS4, both include this sentence as 12:18, as do the RSV and NRSV.
