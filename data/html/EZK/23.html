Some suggest that Ezekiel uses the term in an idiomatic sense of “paramour,” but this still fails to explain how the pronoun relates to the noun. It is more likely that the term refers here to the Egyptians’ genitals. The relative pronoun that follows introduces a more specific description of their genitals.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and their seminal emission was as strong as that of stallions. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="EZK.23.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> This is how you assessed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “you took note of.” The Hebrew verb פָּקַד (paqad) in the Qal implies evaluating something and then acting in light of that judgment; here the prophet depicts Judah as approving of her youthful unfaithfulness and then magnifying it at the present time.

I. Block compares this to the idiom of “licking the plate” (Ezekiel [NICOT], 1:754, n. 137). The text is difficult as the word translated “gnaw” is rare. The noun is used of the shattered pieces of pottery and so could envision a broken cup. But the Piel verb form is used in only one other place (Num 24:8), where it is a denominative from the noun “bone” and seems to mean to “break (bones).” Why it would be collocated with “sherds” is not clear. For this reason some emend the phrase to read “consume its dregs” (see L. C. Allen, Ezekiel [WBC], 2:44) or emend the verb to read “swallow,” as if the intoxicated Oholibah breaks the cup and then eats the very sherds in an effort to get every last drop of the beverage that dampens them.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and tear out your breasts,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The severe action is more extreme than beating the breasts in anguish (Isa 32:12; Nah 2:7).
