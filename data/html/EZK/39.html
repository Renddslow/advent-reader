He is “set apart” from the world over which he rules. At the same time his holiness encompasses his moral authority, which derives from his royal position. As king he has the right to dictate to his subjects how they are to live; indeed his very own character sets the standard for proper behavior. This expression is a common title for the Lord in the book of Isaiah.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="EZK.39.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Realize that it is coming and it will be done, declares the sovereign </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.
