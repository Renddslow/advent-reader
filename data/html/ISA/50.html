         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="ISA.50.1"><span class="content">“Where is your mother’s divorce certificate</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="ISA.50.1"><span class="content">by which I divorced her?</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="ISA.50.1"><span class="content">Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Lord challenges the exiles (Zion’s children) to bring incriminating evidence against him. The rhetorical questions imply that Israel accused the Lord of divorcing his wife (Zion) and selling his children (the Israelites) into slavery to pay off a debt.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="ISA.50.1"><span class="content">Look, you were sold because of your sins;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Lord admits that he did sell the Israelites, but it was because of their sins, not because of some debt he owed. If he had sold them to a creditor, they ought to be able to point him out, but the preceding rhetorical question implies they would not be able to do so.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="ISA.50.1"><span class="content">because of your rebellious acts I divorced your mother.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Lord admits he did divorce Zion, but that too was the result of the nation’s sins. The force of the earlier rhetorical question comes into clearer focus now. The question does not imply that a certificate does not exist and that no divorce occurred. Rather, the question asks for the certificate to be produced so the accuser can see the reason for the divorce in black and white. The Lord did not put Zion away arbitrarily.</span></span></span></span></div>

Another possibility is to take the verbs as referring to past events: “Why did no one meet me when I came? Why did no one answer when I called?” In this case the Lord might be asking why Israel rejected his calls to repent and his offer to deliver them.</span></span></span></span></div>

Here the servant alludes to opposition (something hinted at in 49:4), but also expresses his determination to persevere with the Lord’s help.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ISA.50.4"><span class="content">so that I know how to help the weary.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Heb “to know [?] the weary with a word.” Comparing it with Arabic and Aramaic cognates yields the meaning of “help, sustain.” Nevertheless, the meaning of עוּת (’ut) is uncertain. The word occurs only here in the OT (see BDB 736 s.v.). Various scholars have suggested an emendation to עָנוֹת (’anot) from עָנָה (’anah, “answer”): “so that I know how to respond kindly to the weary.” Since the Qumran scroll 1QIsaa and the Vulgate support the MT reading, that reading is retained.</span></span></span></span></div>
