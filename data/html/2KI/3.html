Jer 39:10). The repetition of the noun is for emphasis. See GKC 396 §123.e. The verb (“making”) is an infinitive absolute, which has to be interpreted in light of the context. The translation above takes it in an imperatival sense. The command need not be understood as literal, but as hyperbolic. Telling them to build cisterns is a dramatic way of leading into the announcement that he would miraculously provide water in the desert. Some prefer to translate the infinitive as an imperfect with the Lord as the understood subject, “I will turn this valley [into] many pools.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="2KI.3.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> for this is what the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> says, ‘You will not feel</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “see.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> any wind or see any rain, but this valley will be full of water and you and your cattle and animals will drink.’ </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="2KI.3.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> This is an easy task for the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and this is easy in the eyes of the Lord.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> he will also hand Moab over to you. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="2KI.3.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content"> You will defeat every fortified city and every important</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “choice” or “select.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> city.

Except for two relatively late texts, the noun קֶצֶף (qetsef) refers to an outburst of divine anger. But it seems unlikely the Lord would be angry with Israel, for he placed his stamp of approval on the campaign (vv. 16-19). D. N. Freedman suggests the narrator, who obviously has a bias against the Omride dynasty, included this observation to show that the Lord would not allow the Israelite king to “have an undiluted victory” (as quoted in M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, II Kings [AB], 52, n. 8). Some suggest that the original source identified Chemosh the Moabite god as the subject and that his name was later suppressed by a conscientious scribe, but this proposal raises more questions than it answers. For a discussion of various views, see M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, II Kings (AB), 47-48, 51-52.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so they broke off the attack</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “they departed from him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and returned to their homeland.</span></span></div>
