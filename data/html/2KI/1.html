For other examples where the idiom “owner of” is used to describe a characteristic of someone, see HALOT 143 s.v. בַּעַל. For example, an “owner of dreams” is one who frequently has dreams (Gen 37:19) and an “owner of anger” is a hot-tempered individual (Prov 22:24).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and had a leather belt</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “belt of skin” (i.e., one made from animal hide).</span></span></span><span class="content"> tied around his waist.” The king</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said, “He is Elijah the Tishbite.”</span></span></div>

See v. 9.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Prophet, this is what the king says, ‘Come down at once!’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn In this second panel of the three-paneled narrative, the king and his captain are more arrogant than before. The captain uses a more official sounding introduction (“this is what the king says”) and the king adds “at once” to the command.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="2KI.1.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Elijah replied to them,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Two medieval Hebrew mss, the LXX, and the Syriac Peshitta have the singular “to him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “If I am indeed a prophet, may fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty soldiers!” Fire from God</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “intense fire.” The divine name may be used idiomatically to emphasize the intensity of the fire. Whether one translates אֱלֹהִים (’elohim) here as a proper name or idiomatically, this addition to the narrative (the name is omitted in the first panel, v. 10b) emphasizes the severity of the judgment and is appropriate given the more intense command delivered by the king to the prophet in this panel.</span></span></span><span class="content"> came down from the sky and consumed him and his fifty soldiers.</span></span></div>

The moral of the story seems clear: Those who act as if they have authority over God and his servants just may pay for their arrogance with their lives; those who, like the third commander, humble themselves and show the proper respect for God’s authority and for his servants will be spared and find God quite cooperative.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with him to the king.</span></span></div>

The repetition emphasizes one of the chapter’s main themes. Israel’s leaders should seek guidance from their own God, not a pagan deity, for Israel’s sovereign God is the one who controls life and death.</span></span></span></span></div>
