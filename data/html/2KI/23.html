It reads: “[which was proclaimed by the man of God] while Jeroboam stood by the altar at a celebration. Then he turned and saw the grave of the man of God [who proclaimed these words].” The extra material attested in the LXX was probably accidentally omitted in the Hebrew tradition when a scribe’s eye jumped from the first occurrence of the phrase “man of God” (which appears right before the extra material) and the second occurrence of the phrase (which appears at the end of the extra material).sn This recalls the prophecy recorded in 1 Kgs 13:2.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="2KI.23.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> He asked, “What is this grave marker I see?” The men from the city replied, “It’s the grave of the prophet</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “man of God.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> who came from Judah and foretold these very things you have done to the altar of Bethel.” </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="2KI.23.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> The king</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said, “Leave it alone!

Apparently the “prophet” referred to in the second half of the verse is the old prophet from Bethel who buried the man of God from Judah in his own tomb and instructed his sons to bury his bones there as well (1 Kgs 13:30-31). One expects the text to read “from Bethel,” but “Samaria” (which was not even built at the time of the incident recorded in 1 Kgs 13) is probably an anachronistic reference to the northern kingdom in general.
