The parallel passage in 2 Chr 22:11 has “and she put” at the beginning of the clause. M. Cogan and H. Tadmor (II Kings [AB], 126) regard the Chronicles passage as an editorial attempt to clarify the difficulty of the original text. They prefer to take “him and his nurse” as objects of the verb “stole” and understand “in the bedroom” as the place where the royal descendants were executed. The phrase בַּחֲדַר הַמִּטּוֹת (bakhadar hammittot), “an inner room of beds,” is sometimes understood as referring to a bedroom (HALOT 293 s.v. חֶדֶר), though some prefer to see here a “room where the covers and cloths were kept for the beds (HALOT 573 s.v. מִטָּת). In either case, it may have been a temporary hideout, for v. 3 indicates that the child hid in the temple for six years.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So he was hidden from Athaliah and escaped execution.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and they hid him from Athaliah and he was not put to death.” The subject of the plural verb (“they hid”) is probably indefinite.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="2KI.11.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> He hid out with his nurse in the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s temple</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he was with her [in] the house of the Lord hiding.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> for six years, while Athaliah was ruling over the land.</span></span></div>

And the two units of you, all the ones going out [on] the Sabbath, and they will guard the guard of the house of the Lord for the king.” The precise meaning of this text is impossible to determine. It would appear that the Carians and royal bodyguard were divided into three units. One unit would serve during the Sabbath; the other two would be off duty on the Sabbath. Jehoiada divided the first unit into three groups and assigned them different locations. The two off duty units were assigned the task of guarding the king.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="2KI.11.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> You must surround the king.
