It is similar to the ordination service in Lev 8. In fact, the execution of what is instructed here is narrated there. But these instructions must have been formulated after or in conjunction with Lev 1-7, for they presuppose a knowledge of the sacrifices. The bulk of the chapter is the consecration of the priests: 1-35. It has the preparation (1-3), washing (4), investiture and anointing (5-9), sin offering (10-14), burnt offering (15-18), installation peace offering (19-26, 31-34), other offerings’ rulings (27-30), and the duration of the ritual (35). Then there is the consecration of the altar (36-37), and the oblations (38-46). There are many possibilities for the study and exposition of this material. The whole chapter is the consecration of tabernacle, altar, people, and most of all the priests. God was beginning the holy operations with sacral ritual. So the overall message would be: Everyone who ministers, everyone who worships, and everything they use in the presence of Yahweh, must be set apart to God by the cleansing, enabling, and sanctifying work of God.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Now this is what</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the thing.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> you are to do for them to consecrate them so that they may minister as my priests.

This is a complete washing, not just of the hands and feet that would follow in the course of service. It had to serve as a symbolic ritual cleansing or purifying as the initial stage in the consecration. The imagery of washing will be used in the NT for regeneration (Titus 3:5).</span></span></span><span class="content"> them with water </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="EXO.29.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> and take the garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hiphil of לָבַשׁ (lavash, “to clothe”) will take double accusatives; so the sign of the accusative is with Aaron, and then with the articles of clothing.

Here it is called a “holy diadem,” a diadem that is distinctly set apart for this service. All the clothing was described as “holy garments,” and so they were all meant to mark the separation of the priests to this holy service. The items of clothing were each intended for different aspects of ministry, and so this step in the consecration was designed to symbolize being set apart for those duties, or, prepared (gifted) to perform the ministry.</span></span></span><span class="content"> on the turban. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="EXO.29.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> You are to take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The act of anointing was meant to set him apart for this holy service within the house of Yahweh. The psalms indicate that no oil was spared in this ritual, for it ran down his beard and to the hem of his garment. Oil of anointing was used for all major offices (giving the label with the passive adjective “mashiah” (or “messiah”) to anyone anointed. In the further revelation of Scripture, the oil came to signify the enablement as well as the setting apart, and often the Holy Spirit came on the person at the anointing with oil. The olive oil was a symbol of the Spirit in the OT as well (Zech 4:4-6). And in the NT “anointing” signifies empowerment by the Holy Spirit for service.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="EXO.29.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> You are to present his sons and clothe them with tunics </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="EXO.29.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> and wrap the sashes around Aaron and his sons</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Hebrew has both the objective pronoun “them” and the names “Aaron and his sons.” Neither the LXX nor Leviticus 8:13 has “Aaron and his sons,” suggesting that this may have been a later gloss in the text.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and put headbands on them, and so the ministry of priesthood will belong to them by a perpetual ordinance.

There is a good deal of debate over the meaning of laying hands on the animals. At the very least it identifies the animal formally as their sacrifice. But it may very well indicate that the animal is a substitute for them as well, given the nature and the effect of the sacrifices.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the bull. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EXO.29.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> You are to kill the bull before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> at the entrance to the tent of meeting </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="EXO.29.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> and take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This act seems to have signified the efficacious nature of the blood, since the horns represented power. This is part of the ritual of the sin offering for laity, because before the priests become priests they are treated as laity. The offering is better described as a purification offering rather than a sin offering, because it was offered, according to Leviticus, for both sins and impurities. Moreover, it was offered primarily to purify the sanctuary so that the once-defiled or sinful person could enter (see J. Milgrom, Leviticus [AB]).</span></span></span><span class="content"> with your finger; all the rest of</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “rest of” has been supplied in the translation for clarification.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the blood you are to pour out at the base of the altar. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="EXO.29.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> You are to take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the lobe</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn S.

The title needs to cover both of them, and if it is called in the traditional way “the sin offering,” that will convey that when people offered it for skin diseases, menstruation, or having babies, they had sinned. That was not the case. Moreover, it is usual to translate the names of the sacrifices by what they do more than what they cover – so peace offering, reparation offering, and purification offering.</span></span></span></span></div>

By consuming the entire animal, God was indicating that he had completely accepted the worshiper, and as it was a sweet smelling fire sacrifice, he was indicating that he was pleased to accept it.

The thumb and the hand represented the instrument to be used for all ministry, and so everything that they “put their hand to” had to be dedicated to God and appropriate for his service. The toe set the foot apart to God, meaning that the walk of the priest had to be consecrated – where he went, how he conducted himself, what life he lived, all belonged to God now.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and then splash the blood all around on the altar. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="EXO.29.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> You are to take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here “it” has been supplied.</span></span></span><span class="content"> on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with him, so that he may be holy,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb in this instance is Qal and not Piel, “to be holy” rather than “sanctify.” The result of all this ritual is that Aaron and his sons will be set aside and distinct in their life and their service.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he and his garments along with his sons and his sons’ garments. </span></span></div>

In Lev 23 this seems to be a sacrificial gesture of things that are for the priests – but they present them first to Yahweh and then receive them back from him. So the waving is not side to side, but forward to Yahweh and then back to the priest.

The ceremony in the earlier passages deals with atonement made for the priests, for people. But here it is the altar that is being sanctified.

It means “to purify, cleanse.” The Hebrews understood that sin and contamination could corrupt and pollute even things, and so they had to be purged.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the altar by making atonement</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The construction is a Piel infinitive construct in an adverbial clause.

S. R. Driver explains it this way (Exodus, 325): If anything comes in contact with the altar, it becomes holy and must remain in the sanctuary for Yahweh’s use. If a person touches the altar, he likewise becomes holy and cannot return to the profane regions. He will be given over to God to be dealt with as God pleases. Anyone who was not qualified to touch the altar did not dare approach it, for contact would have meant that he was no longer free to leave but was God’s holy possession – and might pay for it with his life (see Exod 30:29; Lev 6:18b, 27; and Ezek 46:20).</span></span></span></span></div>

This expression has had a good deal of discussion. (1) Tg. Onq. says “between the two suns,” which the Talmud explains as the time between the sunset and the time the stars become visible. More technically, the first “evening” would be the time between sunset and the appearance of the crescent moon, and the second “evening” the next hour, or from the appearance of the crescent moon to full darkness (see Deut 16:6 – “at the going down of the sun”). (2) Saadia, Rashi, and Kimchi say the first evening is when the sun begins to decline in the west and cast its shadows, and the second evening is the beginning of night. (3) The view adopted by the Pharisees and the Talmudists (b. Pesahim 61a) is that the first evening is when the heat of the sun begins to decrease, and the second evening begins at sunset, or, roughly from 3-5 p.m. The Mishnah (m. Pesahim 5:1) indicates the lamb was killed about 2:30 p.m. – anything before noon was not valid. S. R. Driver concludes from this survey that the first view is probably the best, although the last view was the traditionally accepted one (Exodus, 89-90). Late afternoon or early evening seems to be intended, the time of twilight perhaps.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="EXO.29.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content"> With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “of an ephah” has been supplied for clarity (cf.
