The point is clear that when the people of God attempt to devote their full service and allegiance to God, they encounter opposition from the world. Rather than finding instant blessing and peace, they find conflict. This is the theme that will continue through the plague narratives. But what makes chapter 5 especially interesting is how the people reacted to this opposition. The chapter has three sections: first, the confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh (vv. 1-5); then the report of the stern opposition of the king (vv. 6-14); and finally, the sad account of the effect of this opposition on the people (vv. 15-21).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “Thus says the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Yahweh.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the God of Israel, ‘Release</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form שַׁלַּח (shallakh), the Piel imperative, has been traditionally translated “let [my people] go.” The Qal would be “send”; so the Piel “send away, release, dismiss, discharge.” B. Jacob observes, “If a person was dismissed through the use of this verb, then he ceased to be within the power or sphere of influence of the individual who had dismissed him. He was completely free and subsequently acted entirely on his own responsibility” (Exodus, 115).</span></span></span><span class="content"> my people so that they may hold a pilgrim feast</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb חָגַג (khagag) means to hold a feast or to go on a pilgrim feast. The Arabic cognate of the noun form is haj, best known for the pilgrim flight of Mohammed, the hajira. The form in the text (וְיָחֹגּוּ, vÿyakhoggu) is subordinated to the imperative and thus shows the purpose of the imperative.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to me in the desert.’” </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="EXO.5.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> But Pharaoh said, “Who is the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Yahweh.” This is a rhetorical question, expressing doubt or indignation or simply a negative thought that Yahweh is nothing (see erotesis in E.

The verb שָׁמַע (shama’) followed by “in the voice of” is idiomatic; rather than referring to simple audition – “that I should hear his voice” – it conveys the thought of listening that issues in action – “that I should obey him.”sn The construction of these clauses is similar to (ironically) the words of Moses: “Who am I that I should go?” (3:11).</span></span></span><span class="content"> by releasing</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Piel infinitive construct here has the epexegetical usage with lamed (ל); it explains the verb “obey.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Israel?

For Pharaoh, the Lord (Yahweh) did not exist. So he said “I do not know the Lord [i.e., Yahweh].” The point of the plagues and the exodus will be “that he might know.” Pharaoh will come to know this Yahweh, but not in any pleasant way.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and I will not release Israel!” </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="EXO.5.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go a three-day journey</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “journey” is an adverbial accusative telling the distance that Moses wanted the people to go. It is qualified by “three days.” It is not saying that they will be gone three days, but that they will go a distance that will take three days to cover (see Gen 31:22-23; Num 10:33; 33:8).</span></span></span><span class="content"> into the desert so that we may sacrifice</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The purpose clause here is formed with a second cohortative joined with a vav (ו): “let us go…and let us sacrifice.” The purpose of the going was to sacrifice.sn Where did Moses get the idea that they should have a pilgrim feast and make sacrifices? God had only said they would serve Him in that mountain. In the OT the pilgrim feasts to the sanctuary three times a year incorporated the ideas of serving the Lord and keeping the commands. So the words here use the more general idea of appearing before their God. They would go to the desert because there was no homeland yet. Moses later spoke of the journey as necessary to avoid offending Egyptian sensibilities (8:25-26).</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> our God, so that he does not strike us with plague or the sword.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The last clause of this verse is rather unexpected here: “lest he meet [afflict] us with pestilence or sword.” To fail to comply with the summons of one’s God was to invite such calamities. The Law would later incorporate many such things as the curses for disobedience.

Pharaoh is not asking them why they do this, but rather is accusing them of doing it. He suspects their request is an attempt to get people time away from their labor. In Pharaoh’s opinion, Moses and Aaron were “removing the restraint” (פָּרַע, para’) of the people in an effort to give them rest. Ironically, under the Law the people would be expected to cease their labor when they went to appear before God. He would give them the rest that Pharaoh refused to give. It should be noted also that it was not Israel who doubted that Yahweh had sent Moses, as Moses had feared – but rather Pharaoh.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Return to your labor!” </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="EXO.5.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Pharaoh was thinking,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And Pharaoh said.” This is not the kind of thing that Pharaoh is likely to have said to Moses, and so it probably is what he thought or reasoned within himself.

The emphasis in this section must be on the harsh treatment of the people and Pharaoh’s reason for it – he accuses them of idleness because they want to go and worship. The real reason, of course, is that he wants to discredit Moses (v. 9) and keep the people as slaves.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="EXO.5.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> “You must no longer</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The construction is a verbal hendiadys: לֹא תֹאסִפוּן לָתֵת (lo’ to’sifun latet, “you must not add to give”).

But the basic word-group means “to err, sin, miss the mark, way, goal.” The word in this context seems to indicate that the people of Pharaoh – the slave masters – have failed to provide the straw. Hence: “fault” or “they failed.” But, as indicated, the line has difficult grammar, for it would literally translate: “and you [fem.] sin your people.” Many commentators (so GKC 206 §74.g) wish to emend the text to read with the Greek and the Syriac, thus: “you sin against your own people” (meaning the Israelites are his loyal subjects).</span></span></span><span class="content"> is with your people.”</span></span></div>

The answer from Yahweh not only assures him that all is well, but that there will be a great deliverance. The passage can be divided into three parts: the complaint of Moses (5:22-23), the promise of Yahweh (6:1-9), and the instructions for Moses (6:10-13). Moses complains because God has not delivered his people as he had said he would, and God answers that he will because he is the sovereign covenant God who keeps his word. Therefore, Moses must keep his commission to speak God’s word. See further, E. A. Martens, “Tackling Old Testament Theology,” JETS 20 (1977): 123-32. The message is very similar to that found in the NT, “Where is the promise of his coming?” (2 Pet 3:4). The complaint of Moses (5:22-23) can be worded with Peter’s “Where is the promise of his coming?” theme; the assurance from Yahweh (6:1-9) can be worded with Peter’s “The Lord is not slack in keeping his promises” (2 Pet 3:9); and the third part, the instructions for Moses (6:10-13) can be worded with Peter’s “Prepare for the day of God and speed its coming” (2 Pet 3:12). The people who speak for God must do so in the sure confidence of the coming deliverance – Moses with the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, and Christians with the deliverance from this sinful world.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Moses returned</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Moses returned.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, and said, “Lord,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The designation in Moses’ address is “Lord” (אֲדֹנָי, ’adonay) – the term for “lord” or “master” but pointed as it would be when it represents the tetragrammaton.</span></span></span><span class="content"> why have you caused trouble for this people?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is הֲרֵעֹתָה (hare’otah), the Hiphil perfect of רָעַע (ra’a’).

That God had allowed Pharaoh to oppose them had brought greater pain to the Israelites.sn Moses’ question is rhetorical; the point is more of a complaint or accusation to God, although there is in it the desire to know why. B. Jacob (Exodus, 139) comments that such frank words were a sign of the man’s closeness to God. God never has objected to such bold complaints by the devout.
