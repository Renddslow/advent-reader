Thus in the English Bible ch. 22 has 31 verses, while in the Hebrew Bible it has 30 verses, with the one extra verse attached to ch. 21 in the Hebrew Bible.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he must pay back</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The imperfect tense here has the nuance of obligatory imperfect – he must pay back.</span></span></span><span class="content"> five head of cattle for the ox, and four sheep for the one sheep.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn בָּקַר (baqar) and צֹאן (tso’n) are the categories to which the ox and the sheep belonged, so that the criminal had some latitude in paying back animals.</span></span></span></span></div>

If someone killed a thief who was breaking in during the night, he was not charged because he would not have known it was just a thief, but if it happened during the day, he was guilty of a crime, on the assumption that in daylight the thief posed no threat to the homeowner’s life and could be stopped and made to pay restitution.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="EXO.22.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> If the sun has risen on him, then there is blood guilt for him.

Cassuto (Exodus, 286) does not think the wording can possibly fit an oath; nevertheless, an oath would be involved before God (as he takes it instead of “judges”) – if the man swore, his word would be accepted, but if he would not swear, he would be guilty.</span></span></span><span class="content"> his hand on his neighbor’s goods. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="EXO.22.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> In all cases of illegal possessions,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “concerning every kind [thing] of trespass.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> whether for an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any kind of lost item, about which someone says ‘This belongs to me,’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The text simply has “this is it” (הוּא זֶה, hu’ zeh).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the matter of the two of them will come before the judges,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Again, or “God.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the one whom</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This kind of clause Gesenius calls an independent relative clause – it does not depend on a governing substantive but itself expresses a substantival idea (GKC 445-46 §138.e).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the judges declare guilty</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb means “to be guilty” in Qal; in Hiphil it would have a declarative sense, because a causative sense would not possibly fit.</span></span></span><span class="content"> must repay double to his neighbor. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="EXO.22.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> If a man gives his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it dies or is hurt</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is a Niphal participle from the verb “to break” – “is broken,” which means harmed, maimed, or hurt in any way.</span></span></span><span class="content"> or is carried away</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This verb is frequently used with the meaning “to take captive.” The idea here then is that raiders or robbers have carried off the animal.</span></span></span><span class="content"> without anyone seeing it,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “there is no one seeing.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EXO.22.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> then there will be an oath to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The construct relationship שְׁבֻעַת יְהוָה (shÿvu’at yÿhvah, “the oath of Yahweh”) would require a genitive of indirect object, “an oath [to] Yahweh.” U.

The word נֶשֶׁךְ (neshekh) may be derived from a verb that means “to bite,” and so the idea of usury or interest was that of putting out one’s money with a bite in it (See S.
