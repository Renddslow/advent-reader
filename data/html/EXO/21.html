A precept is stated, and then various cases in which the law is applicable are examined. These rulings are all in harmony with the Decalogue that has just been given and can be grouped into three categories: civil or criminal laws, religious or cultic laws, and moral or humanitarian laws. The civil and criminal laws make up most of chap. 21; the next two chapters mix the other kinds of laws. Among the many studies of this section of the book are F. C. Fensham, “The Role of the Lord in the Legal Sections of the Covenant Code,” VT 26 (1976): 262-74; S. Paul, “Unrecognized Biblical Legal Idioms in Light of Comparative Akkadian Expressions,” RB 86 (1979): 231-39; M. Galston, “The Purpose of the Law According to Maimonides,” JQR 69 (1978): 27-51.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “These are the decisions that you will set before them:</span></span></div>

C. Kaiser, Jr., “Exodus,” EBC 2:431). It seems likely that the term describes someone born a Hebrew, as opposed to a foreigner (S. R. Driver, Exodus, 210). The literature on this includes: M. P. Gray, “The Habiru-Hebrew Problem,” HUCA 29 (1958): 135-202.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he is to serve you for six years, but in the seventh year he will go out free</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The word חָפְשִׁי (khofshi) means “free.” It is possible that there is some connection between this word and a technical term used in other cultures for a social class of emancipated slaves who were freemen again (see I.

Thus, the idea of the master’s “giving” him a wife is clear – the master would have to pay the bride price and make the provision. In this case, the wife and the children are actually the possession of the master unless the slave were to pay the bride price – but he is a slave because he got into debt. The law assumes that the master was better able to provide for this woman than the freed slave and that it was most important to keep the children with the mother.</span></span></span><span class="content"> him a wife, and she bore sons or daughters, the wife and the children will belong to her master, and he will go out by himself. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="EXO.21.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> But if the servant should declare,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The imperfect with the infinitive absolute means that the declaration is unambiguous, that the servant will clearly affirm that he wants to stay with the master.

S. R. Driver (Exodus, 211) says the phrase means “to God,” namely the nearest sanctuary in order that the oath and the ritual might be made solemn, although he does say that it would be done by human judges. That the reference is to Yahweh God is the view also of F. C. Fensham, “New Light on Exodus 21:7 and 22:7 from the Laws of Eshnunna,” JBL 78 (1959): 160-61. Cf. also ASV, NAB, NASB, NCV, NRSV, NLT. Others have made a stronger case that it refers to judges who acted on behalf of God; see C. Gordon, “אלהים in its Reputed Meaning of Rulers, Judges,” JBL 54 (1935): 134-44; and A. E. Draffkorn, “Ilani/Elohim,” JBL 76 (1957): 216-24; cf.

On the subject in general for this chapter, see W. M. Swartley, Slavery, Sabbath, War, and Women, 31-64.</span></span></span><span class="content"> as a female servant,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word אָמָה (’amah) refers to a female servant who would eventually become a concubine or wife; the sale price included the amount for the service as well as the bride price (see B. Jacob, Exodus, 621). The arrangement recognized her honor as an Israelite woman, one who could be a wife, even though she entered the household in service. The marriage was not automatic, as the conditions show, but her treatment was safeguarded come what may. The law was a way, then, for a poor man to provide a better life for a daughter.</span></span></span><span class="content"> she will not go out as the male servants do. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="EXO.21.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> If she does not please</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and if unpleasant (רָעָה, ra’ah) in the eyes of her master.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> her master, who has designated her</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb יָעַד (ya’ad) does not mean “betroth, espouse” as some of the earlier translations had it, but “to designate.” When he bought the girl, he designated her for himself, giving her and her family certain expectations.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for himself, then he must let her be redeemed.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is a Hiphil perfect with vav (ו) consecutive from פָדָה (padah, “to redeem”). Here in the apodosis the form is equivalent to an imperfect: “let someone redeem her” – perhaps her father if he can, or another. U. Cassuto says it can also mean she can redeem herself and dissolve the relationship (Exodus, 268).</span></span></span><span class="content"> He has no right</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he has no authority/power,” for the verb means “rule, have dominion.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to sell her to a foreign nation, because he has dealt deceitfully</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The deceit is in not making her his wife or concubine as the arrangement had stipulated.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with her. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="EXO.21.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> If he designated her for his son, then he will deal with her according to the customary rights</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “after the manner of” (KJV, ASV); NRSV “shall deal with her as with a daughter.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of daughters. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="EXO.21.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> If he takes another wife,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn “wife” has been supplied.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he must not diminish the first one’s food,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The translation of “food” does not quite do justice to the Hebrew word.

Paul, “Exodus 21:10, A Threefold Maintenance Clause,” JNES 28 (1969): 48-53. Paul suggests that the third element listed is not marital rights but ointments since Sumerian and Akkadian texts list food, clothing, and oil as the necessities of life. The translation of “marital rights” is far from certain, since the word occurs only here. The point is that the woman was to be cared for with all that was required for a woman in that situation.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EXO.21.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> If he does not provide her with these three things, then she will go out free, without paying money.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The lessons of slavery and service are designed to bring justice to existing customs in antiquity. The message is: Those in slavery for one reason or another should have the hope of freedom and the choice of service (vv. 2-6). For the rulings on the daughter, the message could be: Women, who were often at the mercy of their husbands or masters, must not be trapped in an unfortunate situation, but be treated well by their masters or husbands (vv. 7-11). God is preventing people who have power over others from abusing it.</span></span></span></span></div>

Gesenius notes that this form after a participle is the equivalent of a sentence representing a contingent action (GKC 333 §112.n). The word shows the result of the action in the opening participle.

It could mean with prior intent, which would be connected with the word in Prov 8:5, 12 which means “understanding” (or “prudence” – fully aware of the way things are). It could be connected also to an Arabic word for “enemy” which would indicate this was done with malice or evil intentions (U. Cassuto, Exodus, 270).

It is opposite of “honor” (כָּבֵד, kaved; Qal “be heavy”; Piel “honor,” as in 20:12) and of “bless.” This verse then could refer to any act contrary to the commandment to honor the parents. B. Jacob (Exodus, 640) cites parallels in Sumerian where people were severely punished for publicly disowning their parents. “21:15, 17 taken together evoke the picture of parents who, physically and verbally, are forcibly turned out of the house (cf.

It may indicate that the child was killed, as in a miscarriage; or it may mean that there was a premature birth. The latter view is taken here because of the way the whole section is written: (1) “her children come out” reflects a birth and not the loss of children, (2) there is no serious damage, and (3) payment is to be set for any remuneration. The word אָסוֹן (’ason) is translated “serious damage.” The word was taken in Mekilta to mean “death.” U. Cassuto says the point of the phrase is that neither the woman or the children that are born die (Exodus, 275). But see among the literature on this: M. G. Kline, “Lex Talionis and the Human Fetus,” JETS 20 (1977): 193-201; W. House, “Miscarriage or Premature Birth: Additional Thoughts on Exodus 21:22-25,” WTJ 41 (1978): 108-23; S. E.
