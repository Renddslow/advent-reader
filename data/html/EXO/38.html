It means “to serve in a host,” especially in a war. It appears that women were organized into bands and served at the tent of meeting. S. R. Driver thinks that this meant “no doubt” washing, cleaning, or repairing (Exodus, 391). But there is no hint of that (see 1 Sam 2:22; and see Ps 68:11 [12 Hebrew text]). They seem to have had more to do than what Driver said.</span></span></span><span class="content"> at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</span></span></div>

But the word often has the idea of “numbering” or “appointing” as well. Here it is an accounting or enumeration of the materials that people brought, so the contemporary term “inventory” is a close approximation. By using this Hebrew word there is also the indication that whatever was given, i.e., appointed for the tabernacle, was changed forever in its use. This is consistent with this Hebrew root, which does have a sense of changing the destiny of someone (“God will surely visit you”). The list in this section will also be tied to the numbering of the people.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, which was counted</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The same verb is used here, but now in the Pual perfect tense, third masculine singular.
