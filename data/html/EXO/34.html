First, Moses is instructed to make new tablets and take them to the mountain (1-4). Then, through the promised theophany God proclaims his moral character (5-8). Moses responds with the reiteration of the intercession (8), and God responds with the renewal of the covenant (10-28). To put these into expository form, as principles, the chapter would run as follows: I. God provides for spiritual renewal (1-4), II. God reminds people of his moral standard (5-9), III. God renews his covenant promises and stipulations (10-28).</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> said to Moses, “Cut out</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The imperative is followed by the preposition with a suffix expressing the ethical dative; it strengthens the instruction for Moses. Interestingly, the verb “cut out, chisel, hew,” is the same verb from which the word for a “graven image” is derived – פָּסַל (pasal).</span></span></span><span class="content"> two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The perfect tense with vav consecutive makes the value of this verb equal to an imperfect tense, probably a simple future here. sn Nothing is said of how God was going to write on these stone tablets at this point, but in the end it is Moses who wrote the words. This is not considered a contradiction, since God is often credited with things he has people do in his place. There is great symbolism in this command – if ever a command said far more than it actually said, this is it. The instruction means that the covenant had been renewed, or was going to be renewed, and that the sanctuary with the tablets in the ark at its center would be built (see Deut 10:1). The first time Moses went up he was empty-handed; when he came down he smashed the tablets because of the Israelites’ sin. Now the people would see him go up with empty tablets and be uncertain whether he would come back with the tablets inscribed again (B. Jacob, Exodus, 977-78).</span></span></span><span class="content"> on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you smashed. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="EXO.34.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Be prepared</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is a Niphal participle that means “be prepared, be ready.” This probably means that Moses was to do in preparation what the congregation had to do back in Exod 19:11-15.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and station yourself</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The same word is used in Exod 33:21.

But this ark may not have been the ark built later; or, it might be the wood box, but Bezalel still had to do all the golden work with it.</span></span></span><span class="content"> early in the morning he went up</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The line reads “and Moses got up early in the morning and went up.” These verbs likely form a verbal hendiadys, the first one with its prepositional phrase serving in an adverbial sense.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to Mount Sinai, just as the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> had commanded him, and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.</span></span></div>

NASB). But it is clear from v. 6 that Yahweh was the subject of the last clause of v. 5 – v. 6 tells how he did it. So if Yahweh is the subject of the first and last clauses of v. 5, it seems simpler that he also be the subject of the second. Moses took his stand there, but God stood by him (B. Jacob, Exodus, 981; U. Cassuto, Exodus, 439). There is no reason to make Moses the subject in any of the verbs of v. 5.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="EXO.34.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> passed by before him and proclaimed:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here is one of the clearest examples of what it means “to call on the name of the Lord,” as that clause has been translated traditionally (וַיִּקְרָא בְשֵׁם יְהוָה, vayyiqra’ vÿshem yÿhvah). It seems more likely that it means “to make proclamation of Yahweh by name.” Yahweh came down and made a proclamation – and the next verses give the content of what he said. This cannot be prayer or praise; it is a proclamation of the nature or attributes of God (which is what his “name” means throughout the Bible). Attempts to make Moses the subject of the verb are awkward, for the verb is repeated in v. 6 with Yahweh clearly doing the proclaiming.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn U.

It is used here and elsewhere in the Bible for departing from pure religion and engaging in pagan religion. The use of the word in this figurative sense is fitting, because the relationship between God and his people is pictured as a marriage, and to be unfaithful to it was a sin. This is also why God is described as a “jealous” or “impassioned” God. The figure may not be merely a metaphorical use, but perhaps a metonymy, since there actually was sexual immorality at the Canaanite altars and poles.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone invites you,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn There is no subject for the verb.

On the one hand Moses’ shining face served to authenticate the message, but on the other hand Moses prevented the people from seeing more than they could handle. The subject matter in the OT, then, is how to authenticate the message. The section again can be subdivided into three points that develop the whole idea: I. The one who spends time with God reflects his glory (29-30). It will not always be as Moses; rather, the glory of the Lord is reflected differently today, but nonetheless reflected. II. The glory of Yahweh authenticates the message (31-32). III. The authentication of the message must be used cautiously with the weak and immature (33-35).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Now when Moses came down</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The temporal clause is composed of the temporal indicator (“and it happened”), followed by the temporal preposition, infinitive construct, and subjective genitive (“Moses”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from Mount Sinai with</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The second clause begins with “and/now”; it is a circumstantial clause explaining that the tablets were in his hand.

Something of the divine glory remained with Moses. The Greek translation of Aquila and the Latin Vulgate convey the idea that he had horns, the primary meaning of the word from which this word is derived. Some have tried to defend this, saying that the glory appeared like horns or that Moses covered his face with a mask adorned with horns. But in the text the subject of the verb is the skin of Moses’ face (see U.
