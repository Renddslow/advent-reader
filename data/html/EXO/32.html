After the giving of the Law and the instructions for the tabernacle, the people get into idolatry. So this section tells what the people were doing when Moses was on the mountain. Here is an instant violation of the covenant that they had just agreed to uphold. But through it all Moses shines as the great intercessor for the people. So the subject matter is the sin of idolatry, its effects and its remedy. Because of the similarities to Jeroboam’s setting up the calves in Dan and Bethel, modern critics have often said this passage was written at that time. U. Cassuto shows how the language of this chapter would not fit an Iron Age setting in Dan. Rather, he argues, this story was well enough known for Jeroboam to imitate the practice (Exodus, 407-10). This chapter can be divided into four parts for an easier exposition: idolatry (32:1-6), intercession (32:7-14), judgment (32:15-29), intercession again (32:30-33:6). Of course, these sections are far more complex than this, but this gives an overview. Four summary statements for expository points might be: I. Impatience often leads to foolish violations of the faith, II. Violations of the covenant require intercession to escape condemnation, III. Those spared of divine wrath must purge evil from their midst, and IV. Those who purge evil from their midst will find reinstatement through intercession. Several important studies are available for this. See, among others, D. R. Davis, “Rebellion, Presence, and Covenant: A Study in Exodus 32-34,” WTJ 44 (1982): 71-87; M. Greenberg, “Moses’ Intercessory Prayer,” Ecumenical Institute for Advanced Theological Studies (1978): 21-35; R. A. Hamer, “The New Covenant of Moses,” Judaism 27 (1978): 345-50; R. L.

Jacob (Exodus, 937-38) argues that Aaron simply did not have the resolution that Moses did, and wanting to keep peace he gave in to the crowd. He also tries to explain that Aaron was wanting to show their folly through the deed. U. Cassuto also says that Aaron’s request for the gold was a form of procrastination, but that the people quickly did it and so he had no alternative but to go through with it (Exodus, 412). These may be right, since Aaron fully understood what was wrong with this, and what the program was all about. The text gives no strong indication to support these ideas, but there are enough hints from the way Aaron does things to warrant such a conclusion.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="EXO.32.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> So all</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This “all” is a natural hyperbole in the narrative, for it means the large majority of the people.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the people broke off the gold earrings that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="EXO.32.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> He accepted the gold</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here “the gold” has been supplied.</span></span></span><span class="content"> from them,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “from their hand.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> fashioned</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb looks similar to יָצַר (yatsar), “to form, fashion” by a plan or a design. That is the verb used in Gen 2:7 for Yahweh God forming the man from the dust of the ground. If it is here, it is the reverse, a human – the dust of the ground – trying to form a god or gods. The active participle of this verb in Hebrew is “the potter.” A related noun is the word יֵצֶּר (yetser), “evil inclination,” the wicked designs or intent of the human heart (Gen 6:5). But see the discussion by B. S. Childs (Exodus [OTL], 555-56) on a different reading, one that links the root to a hollow verb meaning “to cast out of metal” (as in 1 Kgs 7:15).</span></span></span><span class="content"> it with an engraving tool, and made a molten calf.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The word means a “young bull” and need not be translated as “calf” (although “calf” has become the traditional rendering in English). The word could describe an animal three years old. Aaron probably made an inner structure of wood and then, after melting down the gold, plated it. The verb “molten” does not need to imply that the image was solid gold; the word is used in Isa 30:22 for gold plating. So it was a young bull calf that was overlaid with gold, and the gold was fashioned with the stylus.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then they said, “These are your gods,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word could be singular here and earlier; here it would then be “this is your god, O Israel.” However, the use of “these” indicates more than one god was meant by the image. But their statement and their statue, although they do not use the holy name, violate the first two commandments.</span></span></span><span class="content"> O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”</span></span></div>

This was the word used by Moses for their pilgrimage into the wilderness. Aaron seems here to be trying to do what Moses had intended they do, make a feast to Yahweh at Sinai, but his efforts will not compete with the idol. As B. Jacob says, Aaron saw all this happening and tried to rescue the true belief (Exodus, 941).</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.” </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="EXO.32.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> So they got up early on the next day and offered up burnt offerings and brought peace offerings, and the people sat down to eat and drink,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The second infinitive is an infinitive absolute. The first is an infinitive construct with a lamed (ל) preposition, expressing the purpose of their sitting down. The infinitive absolute that follows cannot take the preposition, but with the conjunction follows the force of the form before it (see GKC 340 §113.e).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and they rose up to play.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is לְצַחֵק (lÿtsakheq), a Piel infinitive construct, giving the purpose of their rising up after the festal meal. On the surface it would seem that with the festival there would be singing and dancing, so that the people were celebrating even though they did not know the reason. W. C. Kaiser says the word means “drunken immoral orgies and sexual play” (“Exodus,” EBC 2:478). That is quite an assumption for this word, but is reflected in some recent English versions (e.g., NCV “got up and sinned sexually”; TEV “an orgy of drinking and sex”). The word means “to play, trifle.” It can have other meanings, depending on its contexts. It is used of Lot when he warned his sons-in-law and appeared as one who “mocked” them; it is also used of Ishmael “playing” with Isaac, which Paul interprets as mocking; it is used of Isaac “playing” with his wife in a manner that revealed to Abimelech that they were not brother and sister, and it is used by Potiphar’s wife to say that her husband brought this slave Joseph in to “mock” them. The most that can be gathered from these is that it is playful teasing, serious mocking, or playful caresses. It might fit with wild orgies, but there is no indication of that in this passage, and the word does not mean it. The fact that they were festive and playing before an idol was sufficient.</span></span></span></span></div>

B. S. Childs (Exodus [OTL], 567) reflects the Jewish interpretation that there is a profound paradox in God’s words. He vows the severest punishment but then suddenly conditions it on Moses’ agreement. “Let me alone that I may consume them” is the statement, but the effect is that he has left the door open for intercession. He allows himself to be persuaded – that is what a mediator is for. God could have slammed the door (as when Moses wanted to go into the promised land). Moreover, by alluding to the promise to Abraham God gave Moses the strongest reason to intercede.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that my anger can burn against them and I can destroy them, and I will make from you a great nation.”</span></span></div>

Driver (Exodus, 351) draws on Arabic to show that the meaning of this verb (חָלָה, khalah) was properly “make sweet the face” or “stroke the face”; so here “to entreat, seek to conciliate.” In this prayer, Driver adds, Moses urges four motives for mercy: 1) Israel is Yahweh’s people, 2) Israel’s deliverance has demanded great power, 3) the Egyptians would mock if the people now perished, and 4) the oath God made to the fathers.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> his God and said, “O </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand? </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="EXO.32.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Why</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The question is rhetorical; it really forms an affirmation that is used here as a reason for the request (see GKC 474 §150.e).</span></span></span><span class="content"> should the Egyptians say,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “speak, saying.” This is redundant in English and has been simplified in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> ‘For evil</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “evil” means any kind of life-threatening or fatal calamity. “Evil” is that which hinders life, interrupts life, causes pain to life, or destroys it.

Here Moses is asking God to repent/relent over the judgment he was about to bring, meaning that he should be moved by such compassion that there would be no judgment like that. J. P. Hyatt observes that the Bible uses so many anthropomorphisms because the Israelites conceived of God as a dynamic and living person in a vital relationship with people, responding to their needs and attitudes and actions (Exodus [NCBC], 307).

This has usually been explained as a Qal imperative. S. R. Driver explains it “Fill your hand today,” meaning, take a sacrifice to God and be installed in the priesthood (Exodus, 355). But it probably is a Piel perfect, meaning “they have filled your hands today,” or, “your hand was filled today.” This was an expression meant to say that they had been faithful to God even though it turned them against family and friends – but God would give them a blessing.</span></span></span><span class="content"> today for the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, for each of you was against his son or against his brother, so he has given a blessing to you today.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The text simply has “and to give on you today a blessing.” Gesenius notes that the infinitive construct seems to be attached with a vav (ו; like the infinitive absolute) as the continuation of a previous finite verb. He reads the verb “fill” as an imperative: “fill your hand today…and that to bring a blessing on you, i.e., that you may be blessed” (see GKC 351 §114.p). If the preceding verb is taken as perfect tense, however, then this would also be perfect – “he has blessed you today.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The NJPS’s translation tries to reconcile the two by reading “for what they did with the calf that Aaron had made.” B. S. Childs (Exodus [OTL], 557) explains in some detail why this is not a good translation based on syntactical grounds; he opts for the conclusion that the last three words are a clumsy secondary addition.
