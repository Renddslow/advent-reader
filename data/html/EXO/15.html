The song itself is vv. 1b-18; it falls into three sections – praise to God (1b-3), the cause for the praise (4-13), and the conclusion (14-18). The point of the first section is that God’s saving acts inspire praise from his people; the second is that God’s powerful acts deliver his people from the forces of evil; and the third section is that God’s demonstrations of his sovereignty inspire confidence in him by his people. So the Victory Song is very much like the other declarative praise psalms – the resolve to praise, the power of God, the victory over the enemies, the incomparability of God in his redemption, and the fear of the people. See also C. Cohen, “Studies in Early Israelite Poetry I: An Unrecognized Case of Three Line Staircase Parallelism in the Song of the Sea,” JANESCU 7 (1975): 13-17; D. N. Freedman, “Strophe and Meter in Exodus 15,” A Light unto My Path, 163-203; E. Levine, “Neofiti I: A Study of Exodus 15,” Bib 54 (1973): 301-30; T. C.

The Hebrew expression has כִּי־גָּאֹה גָּאָה (ki ga’oh ga’ah). The basic idea of the verb is “rise up loftily” or “proudly.” But derivatives of the root carry the nuance of majesty or pride (S. R. Driver, Exodus, 132). So the idea of the perfect tense with its infinitive absolute may mean “he is highly exalted” or “he has done majestically” or “he is gloriously glorious.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The word “to ride” can mean on a horse or in a chariot. Some have suggested changing “rider” to “chariot” (re-vocalization) to read “the horse and its chariot.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> he has thrown into the sea.</span></span></div>

It probably had a suffix yod (י) that was accidentally dropped because of the yod (י) on the divine name following. Most scholars posit another meaning for the word. A meaning of “power” fits the line fairly well, forming a hendiadys with strength – “strength and power” becoming “strong power.” Similar lines are in Isa 12:2 and Ps 118:14. Others suggest “protection” or “glory.” However, there is nothing substantially wrong with “my song” in the line – only that it would be a nicer match if it had something to do with strength.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>

The expression indicates that Yahweh is one who understands how to fight and defeat the enemy. The word “war” modifies “man” to reveal that Yahweh is a warrior. Other passages use similar descriptions: Isa 42:13 has “man of wars”; Ps 24:8 has “mighty man of battle.” See F.

Normally a vav (ו) consecutive is used with the preterite, but in some ancient poems the form without the vav appears, as is the case frequently in this poem. That such an archaic form is used should come as no surprise, because the word also uses the yod (י) of the root (GKC 214 §75.dd), and the archaic suffix form (GKC 258 §91.l). These all indicate the antiquity of the poem.</span></span></span></span></div>

The principle here, and elsewhere in Scripture, is that the people of God naturally respond to God in praise for his great acts of deliverance. Few will match the powerful acts that were exhibited in Egypt, but these nonetheless set the tone. The song is certainly typological of the song of the saints in heaven who praise God for delivering them from the bondage of this world by judging the world. The focus of the praise, though, still is on the person (attributes) and works of God.</span></span></span></span></div>

The event teaches that God is able to turn bitter water into sweet water for his people, and he promises to do such things if they obey. He can provide for them in the desert – he did not bring them into the desert to let them die. But there is a deeper level to this story – the healing of the water is incidental to the healing of the people, their lack of trust. The passage is arranged in a neat chiasm, starting with a journey (A), ending with the culmination of the journey (A&apos;); developing to bitter water (B), resolving to sweet water (B&apos;); complaints by the people (C), leading to to the instructions for the people (C&apos;); and the central turning point is the wonder miracle (D).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then Moses led Israel to journey</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb form is unusual; the normal expression is with the Qal, which expresses that they journeyed.

Earlier in the book the word had been used for the “bitter herbs” in the Passover, recalling the bitter labor in bondage. So there may be a double reference here – to the bitter waters and to Egypt itself – God can deliver from either.</span></span></span><span class="content"> but they were not able to drink</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The infinitive construct here provides the direct object for the verb “to be able,” answering the question of what they were not able to do.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the waters of Marah, because</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The causal clause here provides the reason for their being unable to drink the water, as well as a clear motivation for the name.</span></span></span><span class="content"> they were bitter.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Many scholars have attempted to explain these things with natural phenomena. Here Marah is identified with Ain Hawarah. It is said that the waters of this well are notoriously salty and brackish; Robinson said it was six to eight feet in diameter and the water about two feet deep; the water is unpleasant, salty, and somewhat bitter. As a result the Arabs say it is the worst tasting water in the area (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., “Exodus,” EBC 2:398). But that would not be a sufficient amount of water for the number of Israelites in the first place, and in the second, they could not drink it at all.

They were not merely complaining – they were questioning God’s abilities and motives.

It is the Hiphil preterite from יָרָה (yarah), which has a basic meaning of “to point, show, direct.” It then came to mean “to teach”; it is the verb behind the noun “Law” (תּוֹרָה, torah).sn U. Cassuto notes that here is the clue to the direction of the narrative: Israel needed God’s instruction, the Law, if they were going to enjoy his provisions (Exodus, 184).</span></span></span><span class="content"> a tree.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “a [piece of] wood” (cf.

Driver (Exodus, 143) follows some local legends in identifying this tree as one that is supposed to have – even to this day – the properties necessary for making bitter water sweet. B. Jacob (Exodus, 436) reports that no such tree has ever been found, but then he adds that this does not mean there was not such a bush in the earlier days. He believes that here God used a natural means (“showed, instructed”) to sweeten the water. He quotes Ben Sira as saying God had created these things with healing properties in them.</span></span></span><span class="content"> When Moses</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent (Moses) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> threw it into the water, the water became safe to drink.

The meaning of the verb is idiomatic here because it is followed by “to the voice of Yahweh your God.” When this is present, the verb is translated “obey.” The construction is in a causal clause. It reads, “If you will diligently obey.” Gesenius points out that the infinitive absolute in a conditional clause also emphasizes the importance of the condition on which the consequence depends (GKC 342-43 §113.o).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God, and do what is right</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word order is reversed in the text: “and the right in his eyes you do,” or, “[if] you do what is right in his eyes.” The conditional idea in the first clause is continued in this clause.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in his sight, and pay attention</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “give ear.” This verb and the next are both perfect tenses with the vav (ו) consecutive; they continue the sequence of the original conditional clause.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, then all</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The substantive כָּל־ (kol, “all of”) in a negative clause can be translated “none of.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the diseases</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The reference is no doubt to the plagues that Yahweh has just put on them.

The word is the predicate after the pronoun “I”: “I [am] your healer.” The suffix is an objective genitive – the Lord heals them.sn The name I Yahweh am your healer comes as a bit of a surprise. One might expect, “I am Yahweh who heals your water,” but it was the people he came to heal because their faith was weak. God lets Israel know here that he can control the elements of nature to bring about a spiritual response in Israel (see Deut 8).</span></span></span></span></div>

But God had other plans for them, to see if they would trust him wholeheartedly and obey. They did not do very well this first time, and they will have to learn how to obey. The lesson is clear: God uses adversity to test his people’s loyalty. The response to adversity must be prayer to God, for he can turn the bitter into the sweet, the bad into the good, and the prospect of death into life.</span></span></span><span class="content"> where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the water.</span></span></div>
