There has been the deliverance, the testing passages, the provision in the wilderness, and the warfare. Any God who can do all this for his people deserves their allegiance. In chap. 18 the Lawgiver is giving advice, using laws and rulings, but then he is given advice to organize the elders to assist. Thus, when the Law is fully revealed, a system will be in place to administer it. The point of the passage is that a great leader humbly accepts advice from other godly believers to delegate responsibility. He does not try to do it all himself; God does not want one individual to do it all. The chapter has three parts: vv. 1-12 tell how Jethro heard and came and worshiped and blessed; vv. 13-23 have the advice of Jethro, and then vv. 24-27 tell how Moses implemented the plan and Jethro went home.

Butler, “An Anti-Moses Tradition,” JSOT 12 (1979): 9-15.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, that</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This clause beginning with כִּי (ki) answers the question of what Jethro had heard; it provides a second, explanatory noun clause that is the object of the verb – “he heard (1) all that God had done… (2) that he had brought….” See R.

The preposition in the sentiment is the bet (ב) essentiae (giving the essence – see GKC 379 §119.i). Not mentioned earlier, the name has become even more appropriate now that God has delivered Moses from Pharaoh again. The word for “help” is a common word in the Bible, first introduced as a description of the woman in the Garden. It means to do for someone what he or she cannot do for himself or herself. Samuel raised the “stone of help” (Ebenezer) when Yahweh helped Israel win the battle (1 Sam 7:12).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and delivered</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The verb “delivered” is an important motif in this chapter (see its use in vv. 8, 9, and 10 with reference to Pharaoh).</span></span></span><span class="content"> me from the sword of Pharaoh”).</span></span></div>

But chap. 19 suggests that they left Rephidim to go the 24 miles to Sinai. It may be that this chapter fits in chronologically after the move to Sinai, but was placed here thematically. W. C. Kaiser defends the present location of the story by responding to other reasons for the change given by Lightfoot, but does not deal with the travel locations (W. C.

It begins to provide details of the event that the previous verse summarizes. The announcement in verse 6 may have come in advance by means of a messenger or at the time of arrival, either of which would fit with the attention to formal greetings in verse 7. This would suit a meeting between two important men; the status of Moses has changed. The LXX solves the problem by taking the pronoun “I” as the particle “behold” and reads it this way: “one said to Moses, ‘Behold, your father-in-law has come….’”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two sons with her.” </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="EXO.18.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This is more than polite oriental custom.

The LXX translated it “he shuddered.” U. Cassuto suggests that that rendering was based on the midrashic interpretation in b. Sanhedrin 94b, “he felt cuts in his body” – a wordplay on the verb (Exodus, 215-16).</span></span></span><span class="content"> because of all the good that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> had done for Israel, whom he had delivered from the hand of Egypt. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="EXO.18.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Jethro said, “Blessed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This is a common form of praise. The verb בָּרוּךְ (barukh) is the Qal passive participle of the verb.

In the present translation the phrase “he has destroyed them” is supplied. Others take the last prepositional phrase to be the completion and supply only a verb: “[he was] above them.” U. Cassuto (Exodus, 216) takes the word “gods” to be the subject of the verb “act proudly,” giving the sense of “precisely (כִּי, ki) in respect of these things of which the gods of Egypt boasted – He is greater than they (עֲלֵיהֶם, ‘alehem).” He suggests rendering the clause, “excelling them in the very things to which they laid claim.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="EXO.18.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is “and he took” (cf. KJV, ASV, NASB). It must have the sense of getting the animals for the sacrifice. The Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate have “offered.” But Cody argues because of the precise wording in the text Jethro did not offer the sacrifices but received them (A. Cody, “Exodus 18,12: Jethro Accepts a Covenant with the Israelites,” Bib 49 [1968]: 159-61).</span></span></span><span class="content"> a burnt offering and sacrifices for God,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Jethro brought offerings as if he were the one who had been delivered. The “burnt offering” is singular, to honor God first. The other sacrifices were intended for the invited guests to eat (a forerunner of the peace offering). See B.

He did not necessarily do this every day, but it was time now to do it. The people would come to solve their difficulties or to hear instruction from Moses on decisions to be made.

To inquire of God would be to seek God’s will on a matter, to obtain a legal decision on a matter, or to settle a dispute.

This is introducing the aspect of the work that only Moses could do, what he has been doing. He is to be before God for the people, to pray for them, to appeal on their behalf.

Spiritually responsible people are to be selected to help in the work of the ministry (teaching, deciding cases, meeting needs), so that there will be peace, and so that leaders will not be exhausted. Probably capable people are more ready to do that than leaders are ready to relinquish control. But leaders have to be willing to take the risk, to entrust the task to others. Here Moses is the model of humility, receiving correction and counsel from Jethro. And Jethro is the ideal adviser, for he has no intention of remaining there to run the operation.</span></span></span></span></div>
