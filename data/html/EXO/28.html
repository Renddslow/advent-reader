To most of them this reflects the later Zadokite priesthood of the writer’s (P’s) day that was referred to Mosaic legislation for authentication. But there is no compelling reason why this should be late; it is put late because it is assumed to be P, and that is assumed to be late. But both assumptions are unwarranted. This lengthy chapter could be divided this way: instructions for preparing the garments (1-5), details of the apparel (6-39), and a warning against deviating from these (40-43). The subject matter of the first part is that God requires that his chosen ministers reflect his holy nature; the point of the second part is that God requires his ministers to be prepared to fulfill the tasks of the ministry, and the subject matter of the third part is that God warns all his ministers to safeguard the holiness of their service.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “And you, bring near</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is the Hiphil imperative of the root קָרַב (qarav, “to draw near”).

The word means “to be a priest” or “to act as a priest.” The etymology of the word for priest, כֹּהֵן (kohen), is uncertain.</span></span></span><span class="content"> – Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="EXO.28.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> You must make holy garments</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The genitive “holiness” is the attribute for “garments” – “garments of holiness.” The point of the word “holy” is that these garments would be distinctive from ordinary garments, for they set Aaron apart to sanctuary service and ministry.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for your brother Aaron, for glory and for beauty.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The expression is לְכָבוֹד וּלְתִפְארֶת (lÿkhavod ulÿtif’aret, “for glory and for beauty”). W. C. Kaiser (“Exodus,” EBC 2:465), quoting the NIV’s “to give him dignity and honor,” says that these clothes were to exalt the office of the high priest as well as beautify the worship of God (which explains more of what the text has than the NIV rendering). The meaning of the word “glory” has much to do with the importance of the office, to be sure, but in Exodus the word has been used also for the brilliance of the presence of Yahweh, and so the magnificence of these garments might indeed strike the worshiper with the sense of the exaltation of the service.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="EXO.28.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> You</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And you, you will speak to.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> are to speak to all who are specially skilled,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “wise of heart.” The word for “wise” (חַכְמֵי, khakhme, the plural construct form) is from the word group that is usually translated “wisdom, wise, be wise,” but it has as its basic meaning “skill” or “skillful.” This is the way it is used in 31:3, 6 and 35:10 etc. God gave these people “wisdom” so that they would know how to make these things. The “heart” for the Hebrews is the locus of understanding, the mind and the will. To be “wise of heart” or “wise in heart” means that they had the understanding to do skillful work, they were talented artisans and artists.</span></span></span><span class="content"> whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn There is no necessity to take this as a reference to the Holy Spirit who produces wisdom in these people, although that is not totally impossible. A number of English versions (e.g., NAB, NIV, NCV, NRSV, TEV, CEV, NLT) do not even translate the word “spirit.” It probably refers to their attitude and ability. U. Cassuto has “to all the artisans skilled in the making of stately robes, in the heart [i.e., mind] of each of whom I have implanted sagacity in his craft so that he may do his craft successfully” (Exodus, 371).</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that they may make</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is the perfect tense with the vav (ו) consecutive; after the instruction to speak to the wise, this verb, equal to an imperfect, will have the force of purpose.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Aaron’s garments to set him apart</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “to sanctify him” (ASV) or “to consecrate him” (KJV, NASB, NRSV).

Their meaning is uncertain (see the extended discussion in C. Houtman, Exodus, 3:473-75). A related noun describes gold fasteners and the “settings,” or “mountings,” for precious stones (28:11, 13, 14, 20, 25; 36:18; 39:6, 13, 16, 18; cf. Ps 45:14). The word “fitted” in 28:4 reflects the possibility that “the tunic is to be shaped by sewing, … so that it will fit tightly around the body” (C. Houtman, Exodus, 3:475).</span></span></span><span class="content"> tunic, a turban, and a sash.

There is no clear evidence of their size or shape or the material of which they were made, but they seem to have been familiar items to Moses and the people. The best example of their use comes from 1 Sam 14:36-42. Some have suggested from the etymologies that they were light and dark objects respectively, perhaps stones or sticks or some other object. They seem to have fallen out of use after the Davidic period when the prophetic oracles became popular. It may be that the title “breastpiece of judgment” indicates that these objects were used for making “decisions” (J. P. Hyatt, Exodus [NCBC], 283-84). U. Cassuto has the most thorough treatment of the subject (Exodus, 378-82); he lists several very clear rules for their uses gathered from their instances in the Bible, including that they were a form of sacred lot, that priests or leaders of the people only could use them, and that they were used for discovering the divine will in areas that were beyond human knowledge.</span></span></span><span class="content"> into the breastpiece of decision; and they are to be over Aaron’s heart when he goes in before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.

The bells that are between them possibly have the intent of drawing God’s attention as the priest moves and the bells jingle (anthropomorphic, to be sure), or that the people would know that the priest was still alive and moving inside. Some have suggested that the pomegranate may have recalled the forbidden fruit eaten in the garden (the gems already have referred to the garden), the reason for the priest entering for atonement, and the bells would divert the eye (of God) to remind him of the need.

But there will inevitably be iniquity involved. U. Cassuto explains that Aaron “will atone for all the transgressions committed in connection with the order of the service, the purity of the consecrated things, or the use of the holy gifts, for the declaration engraved on the plate will prove that everything was intended to be holy to the Lord, and if aught was done irregularly, the intention at least was good” (Exodus, 385).</span></span></span><span class="content"> which the Israelites are to sanctify by all their holy gifts;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The clause reads: “according to/by all the gifts of their holiness.” The genitive is an attributive genitive, the suffix on it referring to the whole bound construction – “their holy gifts.” The idea of the line is that the people will consecrate as holy things gifts they bring to the sanctuary.</span></span></span><span class="content"> it will always be on his forehead, for their acceptance</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This clause is the infinitive construct with the lamed preposition, followed by the prepositional phrase: “for acceptance for them.” This infinitive provides the purpose or result of the act of wearing the dedicatory frontlet – that they will be acceptable.</span></span></span><span class="content"> before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="EXO.28.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content"> You are to weave</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn It is difficult to know how to translate וְשִׁבַּצְּתָּ (vÿshibbatsta); it is a Piel perfect with the vav (ו) consecutive, and so equal to the imperfect of instruction. Some have thought that this verb describes a type of weaving and that the root may indicate that the cloth had something of a pattern to it by means of alternate weaving of the threads. It was the work of a weaver (39:27) and not so detailed as certain other fabrics (26:1), but it was more than plain weaving (S. R. Driver, Exodus, 310). Here, however, it may be that the fabric is assumed to be in existence and that the action has to do with sewing (C.

The anointing of Aaron is specifically required in the Law, for he is to be the High Priest. The expression “ordain them” might also be translated as “install them” or “consecrate them”; it literally reads “and fill their hands,” an expression for the consecration offering for priesthood in Lev 8:33. The final instruction to sanctify them will involve the ritual of the atoning sacrifices to make the priests acceptable in the sanctuary.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and ordain them</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “fill their hand.” As a result of this installation ceremony they will be officially designated for the work.

The last verb is the perfect tense with the vav consecutive, and so it too is equal to a final imperfect – but it would show the result of bearing the iniquity. The idea is that if they approached the holy things with a lack of modesty, perhaps like the pagans who have nakedness and sexuality as part of the religious ritual, they would pollute the holy things, and it would be reckoned to them for iniquity and they would die.</span></span></span><span class="content"> It is to be a perpetual ordinance for him and for his descendants</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “seed.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> after him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn So the priests were to make intercession for the people, give decisions from God’s revealed will, enter his presence in purity, and represent holiness to Yahweh. The clothing of the priests provided for these functions, but in a way that brought honor and dignity. A priest was, therefore, to serve in purity, holiness, and fear (Malachi). There is much that can be derived from this chapter to form principles of spiritual leadership, but the overall point can be worded this way: Those whom God selects to minister to the congregation through intercessory prayer, divine counsel, and sacrificial worship, must always represent the holiness of Yahweh in their activities and demeanor.</span></span></span></span></div>
