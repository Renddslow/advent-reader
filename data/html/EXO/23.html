It is largely promise, but it is part of the Law and so demands compliance by faith. Its points are: God promises to send his angel to prepare the way before his obedient servants (20-23); God promises blessing for his loyal servants (24-33). So in the section one learns that God promises his protection (victory) and blessing (through his angel) for his obedient and loyal worshipers.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “I am going to send</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The particle הִנֵּה (hinneh) with the active participle indicates imminent future, something God is about to do.</span></span></span><span class="content"> an angel</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The word is מַלְאָךְ (mal’akh, “messenger, angel”). This angel is to be treated with the same fear and respect as Yahweh, for Yahweh will be speaking in him. U. Cassuto (Exodus, 305-6) says that the words of the first clause do not imply a being distinct from God, for in the ancient world the line of demarcation between the sender and the sent is liable easily to be blurred. He then shows how the “Angel of Yahweh” in Genesis is Yahweh. He concludes that the words here mean “I will guide you.” Christian commentators tend to identify the Angel of Yahweh as the second person of the Trinity (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., “Exodus,” EBC 2:446). However, in addition to being a preincarnate appearance, the word could refer to Yahweh – some manifestation of Yahweh himself.</span></span></span><span class="content"> before you to protect you as you journey</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “protect you in the way.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and to bring you into the place that I have prepared.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is the Hiphil perfect of the verb כּוּן (kun, “to establish, prepare”).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="EXO.23.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> Take heed because of him, and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgressions, for my name</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This means “the manifestation of my being” is in him (S.

U. Cassuto thinks the reference to “hornets” in v. 28 may be a reference to this fear, an unreasoning dread, rather than to another insect invasion (Exodus, 308). Others suggest it is symbolic of an invading army or a country like Egypt or literal insects (see E. Neufeld, “Insects as Warfare Agents in the Ancient Near East,” Or 49 [1980]: 30-57).</span></span></span><span class="content"> before you, and I will destroy</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “kill.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> all the people whom you encounter; I will make all your enemies turn their backs</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The text has “and I will give all your enemies to you [as] a back.” The verb of making takes two accusatives, the second being the adverbial accusative of product (see GKC 371-72 §117.ii, n. 1).</span></span></span><span class="content"> to you. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="EXO.23.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content"> I will send</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and I will send.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> hornets before you that will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you. </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="EXO.23.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content"> I will not drive them out before you in one year, lest the land become desolate and the wild animals</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the beast of the field.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> multiply against you. </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="EXO.23.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content"> Little by little</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The repetition expresses an exceptional or super-fine quality (see GKC 396 §123.e).</span></span></span><span class="content"> I will drive them out before you, until you become fruitful and inherit the land. </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="EXO.23.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content"> I will set</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is a perfect tense with vav consecutive.</span></span></span><span class="content"> your boundaries from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn In the Hebrew Bible “the River” usually refers to the Euphrates (cf.
