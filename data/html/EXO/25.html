The first paragraph introduces the issue of the heavenly pattern for the construction, calls for the people to make willing offerings (vv. 2-7), and explains the purpose for these offerings (vv. 8-9). The message here is that God calls his people to offer of their substance willingly so that his sanctuary may be made.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> spoke to Moses: </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="EXO.25.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> “Tell the Israelites to take</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is וְיִקְחוּ (vÿyiqkhu), the Qal imperfect or jussive with vav; after the imperative “speak” this verb indicates the purpose or result: “speak…that they may take” and continues with the force of a command.</span></span></span><span class="content"> an offering</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The “offering” (תְּרוּמָה, tÿrumah) is perhaps better understood as a contribution since it was a freewill offering. There is some question about the etymology of the word. The traditional meaning of “heave-offering” derives from the idea of “elevation,” a root meaning “to be high” lying behind the word. B. Jacob says it is something sorted out of a mass of material and designated for a higher purpose (Exodus, 765). S. R. Driver (Exodus, 263) corrects the idea of “heave-offering” by relating the root to the Hiphil form of that root, herim, “to lift” or “take off.” He suggests the noun means “what is taken off” from a larger mass and so designated for sacred purposes. The LXX has “something taken off.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> for me; from every person motivated by a willing</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb יִדְּבֶנּוּ (yiddÿvennu) is related to the word for the “freewill offering” (נְדָבָה, nÿdavah).

C. Kaiser, Jr., “Exodus,” EBC 2:452). B. Jacob takes the view that these are not simply colors that are being introduced here, but fabrics dyed with these colors (Exodus, 765). At any rate, the sequence would then be metals, fabrics, and leathers (v. 5).</span></span></span><span class="content"> fine linen,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This is generally viewed as a fine Egyptian linen that had many more delicate strands than ordinary linen.</span></span></span><span class="content"> goat’s hair,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Goat’s hair was spun into yarn (35:26) and used to make the material for the first tent over the dwelling.

C. Kaiser compares this to morocco leather (“Exodus,” EBC 2:453); it was skin that had all the wool removed and then was prepared as leather and dyed red. N. M. Sarna, on the other hand, comments, “The technique of leather production is never described [in ancient Hebrew texts]. Hence, it is unclear whether Hebrew me’oddamim (מְאָדָּמִים), literally ‘made red,’ refers to the tanning or dyeing process” (Exodus [JPSTC], 157).</span></span></span><span class="content"> fine leather,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The meaning of the word תְּחָשִׁים (tÿkhashim) is debated. The Arabic tuhas or duhas is a dolphin, and so some think a sea animal is meant – something like a dolphin or porpoise (cf. NASB; ASV “sealskins”; NIV “hides of sea cows”). Porpoises are common in the Red Sea; their skins are used for clothing by the bedouin. The word has also been connected to an Egyptian word for “leather” (ths); see S. R. Driver, Exodus, 265. Some variation of this is followed by NRSV (“fine leather”) and NLT (“fine goatskin leather”). Another suggestion connects this word to an Akkadian one that describes a precious stone that is yellow or ornge and also leather died with the color of this stone (N. M. Sarna, Exodus [JPSTC], 157-58).</span></span></span><span class="content"> acacia</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The wood of the acacia is darker and harder than oak, and so very durable.</span></span></span><span class="content"> wood, </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="EXO.25.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for fragrant incense, </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="EXO.25.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> onyx stones, and other gems to be set in the ephod and in the breastpiece. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="EXO.25.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Let them make</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is a perfect with vav (ו) consecutive; it follows in the sequence initiated by the imperative in v. 2 and continues with the force of a command.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for me a sanctuary,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word here is מִקְדּשׁ (miqdash), “a sanctuary” or “holy place”; cf.

The word rendered “pattern” is related to the verb “to build”; it suggests a model. S. R. Driver notes that in ancient literature there is the account of Gudea receiving in a dream a complete model of a temple he was to erect (Exodus, 267). In this passage Moses is being shown something on the mountain that should be the pattern of the earthly sanctuary. The most plausible explanation of what he was shown comes from a correlation with comments in the Letter to the Hebrews and the book of Revelation, which describe the heavenly sanctuary as the true sanctuary, and the earthly as the copy or shadow. One could say that Moses was allowed to see what John saw on the island of Patmos, a vision of the heavenly sanctuary. That still might not explain what it was, but it would mean he saw a revelation of the true tent, and that would imply that he learned of the spiritual and eternal significance of all of it. The fact that Israel’s sanctuary resembled those of other cultures does not nullify this act of revelation; rather, it raises the question of where the other nations got their ideas if it was not made known early in human history. One can conclude that in the beginning there was much more revealed to the parents in the garden than Scripture tells about (Cain and Abel did know how to make sacrifices before Leviticus legislated it). Likewise, one cannot but guess at the influence of the fallen Satan and his angels in the world of pagan religion. Whatever the source, at Sinai God shows the true, and instructs that it all be done without the pagan corruptions and additions. U. Cassuto notes that the existence of these ancient parallels shows that the section on the tabernacle need not be dated in the second temple period, but fits the earlier period well (Exodus, 324).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the pattern of all its furnishings – you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The pronoun is plural.</span></span></span><span class="content"> must make it exactly so.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Among the many helpful studies on the tabernacle, include S.

The point of this item in the tabernacle is to underscore the focus: the covenant people must always have God’s holy standard before them as they draw near to worship.

The noun is formed from the word “to make atonement.” The item that the Israelites should make would be more than just a lid for the ark. It would be the place where atonement was signified. The translation of “covering” is probably incorrect, for it derives from a rare use of the verb, if the same verb at all (the evidence shows “cover” is from another root with the same letters as this). The value of this place was that Yahweh sat enthroned above it, and so the ark essentially was the “footstool.” Blood was applied to the lid of the box, for that was the place of atonement (see S. R.

The cherubim then signify two things here: by their outstretched wings they form the throne of God who sits above the ark (with the Law under his feet), and by their overshadowing and guarding they signify this as the place of atonement where people must find propitiation to commune with God. Until then they are barred from his presence. See U.

The text makes it clear that here God would meet with Moses (“you” is singular) and then he would speak to the people – he is the mediator of the covenant. S. R. Driver (Exodus, 272) makes the point that the verb here is not the word that means “to meet by chance” (as in Exod 3:18), but “to meet” by appointment for a purpose (וְנוֹעַדְתִּי, vÿno’adti). The parallel in the NT is Jesus Christ and his work. The theology is that the Law condemns people as guilty of sin, but the sacrifice of Christ makes atonement. So he is the “place of propitiation (Rom 3:25) who gains communion with the Father for sinners. A major point that could be made from this section is this: At the center of worship must be the atoning work of Christ – a perpetual reminder of God’s righteous standard (the testimony in the ark) and God’s gracious provision (the atonement lid).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is placed here in the text: “and I will speak”; it has been moved in this translation to be closer to the direct object clause.</span></span></span><span class="content"> from above the atonement lid, from between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you about all that I will command you for the Israelites.</span></span></div>

To expound this correctly, though, since it is an instruction section for building the lampstand, the message would be: God requires that his people ensure that light will guide the way of access to God. The breakdown for exposition could be the instructions for preparation for light (one lamp, several branches), then instructions for the purpose and maintenance of the lamps, and then the last verse telling the divine source for the instructions. Naturally, the metaphorical value of light will come up in the study, especially from the NT. So in the NT there is the warning that if churches are unfaithful God will remove their lampstand, their ministry (Rev 2-3).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>
