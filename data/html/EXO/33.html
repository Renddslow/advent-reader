Heb “[in] one moment I will go up in your midst and I will destroy you.” The verse is certainly not intended to say that God was about to destroy them. That, plus the fact that he has announced he will not go in their midst, leads most commentators to take this as a conditional clause: “If I were to do such and such, then….”</span></span></span><span class="content"> I might destroy you.

If that section is not part of the exposition, it would have to be explained as the background. The point is that sinfulness prevents the active presence of the Lord leading his people. But then the rest of chap. 33 forms the development. In vv. 7-11 there is the gracious provision: the Lord reveals through his faithful mediator. The Lord was leading his people, but now more remotely because of their sin. Then, in vv. 12-17 Moses intercedes for the people, and the intercession of the mediator guarantees the Lord’s presence. The point of all of this is that God wanted the people to come to know that if he was not with them they should not go. Finally, the presence of the Lord is verified to the mediator by a special revelation (18-23). The point of the whole chapter is that by his grace the Lord renews the promise of his presence by special revelation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Moses took</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Moses took.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the tent</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A widespread contemporary view is that this section represents a source that thought the tent of meeting was already erected (see S. R. Driver, Exodus, 359). But the better view is that this is a temporary tent used for meeting the Lord. U. Cassuto explains this view very well (Exodus, 429-30), namely, that because the building of the tabernacle was now in doubt if the Lord was not going to be in their midst, another plan seemed necessary. Moses took this tent, his tent, and put some distance between the camp and it. Here he would use the tent as the place to meet God, calling it by the same name since it was a surrogate tent. Thus, the entire section was a temporary means of meeting God, until the current wrath was past.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and pitched it outside the camp, at a good distance</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The infinitive absolute is used here as an adverb (see GKC 341 §113.h).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting.

The seeking here would indicate seeking an oracle from Yahweh or seeking to find a resolution for some difficulty (as in 2 Sam 21:1) or even perhaps coming with a sacrifice. B. Jacob notes that the tent was even here a place of prayer, for the benefit of the people (Exodus, 961). It is not known how long this location was used.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> would go out to the tent of meeting that was outside the camp.</span></span></div>

The temporal clause is then formed with the infinitive construct of יָצָא (yatsa’), with “Moses” as the subjective genitive: “and it was according to the going out of Moses.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the tent, all the people would get up</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “rise up.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and stand at the entrance to their tents</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The subject of this verb is specified with the individualizing use of “man”: “and all Israel would station themselves, each person (man) at the entrance to his tent.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and watch</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The perfect tense with the vav (ו) continues the sequence of the customary imperfect.

The idea is that the people would get up (rise) when the cloud was there and then worship, meaning in part bow down. When the cloud was not there, there was access to seek God.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EXO.33.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> would speak to Moses face to face,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn “Face to face” is circumstantial to the action of the verb, explaining how they spoke (see GKC 489-90 §156.c). The point of this note of friendly relationship with Moses is that Moses was “at home” in this tent speaking with God. Moses would derive courage from this when he interceded for the people (B. Jacob, Exodus, 966).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the way a person speaks</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb in this clause is a progressive imperfect.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to a friend.

R. Driver summarizes it this way: that I may understand what your nature and character is, and shape my petitions accordingly, so that I may find grace in your sight, and my future prayers may be answered (Exodus, 361).</span></span></span><span class="content"> that I may continue to find</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The purpose clause simply uses the imperfect, “that I may find.” But since he already has found favor in God’s eyes, he is clearly praying that it be so in the future as well as now.</span></span></span><span class="content"> favor in your sight. And see</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb “see” (an imperative) is a request for God to acknowledge Israel as his people by providing the divine leadership needed. So his main appeal will be for the people and not himself. To underscore this, he repeats “see” the way the section opened.</span></span></span><span class="content"> that this nation is your people.” </span></span></div>

The “presence” probably refers to the angel of the presence or some similar manifestation of God’s leading and caring for his people.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will go with you,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “with you” is not in the Hebrew text, but is implied.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and I will give you rest.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The expression certainly refers to the peace of mind and security of knowing that God was with them. But the expression came to mean “settle them in the land of promise” and give them rest and peace from their enemies. U. Cassuto (Exodus, 434) observes how in 32:10 God had told Moses, “Leave me alone” (“give me rest”), but now he promises to give them rest. The parallelism underscores the great transition through intercession.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>

It then follows in sequence the verb “you have found favor,” meaning you stand in that favor, and so it means “I have known you” and still do (equal to the present perfect). The emphasis, however, is on the results of the action, and so “I know you.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> you by name.”</span></span></div>

He wanted to see God in all his majesty. The LXX chose to translate this without a word for “glory” or “honor”; instead they used the pronoun seautou, “yourself” – show me the real You. God tells him that he cannot see it fully, but in part. It will be enough for Moses to disclose to him the reality of the divine presence as well as God’s moral nature. It would be impossible for Moses to comprehend all of the nature of God, for there is a boundary between God and man. But God would let him see his goodness, the sum of his nature, pass by in a flash. B. Jacob (Exodus, 972) says that the glory refers to God’s majesty, might, and glory, as manifested in nature, in his providence, his laws, and his judgments. He adds that this glory should and would be made visible to man – that was its purpose in the world.</span></span></span></span></div>

The “name of Yahweh” (rendered “the name of the Lord” throughout) refers to his divine attributes revealed to his people, either in word or deed. What will be focused on first will be his grace and compassion.</span></span></span><span class="content"> before you; I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn God declares his mercy and grace in similar terms to his earlier self-revelation (“I am that I am”): “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.” In other words, the grace and mercy of God are bound up in his own will. Obviously, in this passage the recipients of that favor are the penitent Israelites who were forgiven through Moses’ intercession. The two words are at the heart of God’s dealings with people. The first is חָנַן (khanan, “to be gracious, show favor”). It means to grant favor or grace to someone, grace meaning unmerited favor. All of God’s dealings are gracious, but especially in forgiving sins and granting salvation it is critical. Parallel to this is רָחַם (rakham), a word that means “show compassion, tender mercy.” It is a word that is related to the noun “womb,” the connection being in providing care and protection for that which is helpless and dependent – a motherly quality. In both of these constructions the verbs simply express what God will do, without explaining why. See further, J. R. Lundbom, “God’s Use of the Idem per idem to Terminate Debate,” HTR 71 (1978): 193-201; and J.

Driver says, though, while this may indicate just the “afterglow” that he leaves behind him, it was enough to suggest what the full brilliancy of his presence must be (Exodus, 363; see also Job 26:14).</span></span></span><span class="content"> but my face must not be seen.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Niphal imperfect could simply be rendered “will not be seen,” but given the emphasis of the preceding verses, it is more binding than that, and so a negated obligatory imperfect fits better: “it must not be seen.” It would also be possible to render it with a potential imperfect tense: “it cannot be seen.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>
