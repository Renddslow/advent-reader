For Yahweh to say “I am about to plague you” could just as easily mean “I am about to strike you.” That is why these “plagues” can be described as “blows” received from God.</span></span></span><span class="content"> all your territory with frogs.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “plague all your border with frogs.” The expression “all your border” is figurative for all the territory of Egypt and the people and things that are within the borders (also used in Exod 10:4, 14, 19; 13:7).sn This word for frogs is mentioned in the OT only in conjunction with this plague (here and Pss 78:45, 105:30). R. A. Cole (Exodus [TOTC], 91) suggests that this word “frogs” (צְפַרְדְּעִים, tsÿfardÿ’im) may be an onomatopoeic word, something like “croakers”; it is of Egyptian origin and could be a Hebrew attempt to write the Arabic dofda.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="EXO.8.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> The Nile will swarm</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The choice of this verb שָׁרַץ (sharats) recalls its use in the creation account (Gen 1:20).

The verb would be simply translated “honor yourself” or “deck yourself with honor.” It can be used in the bad sense of self-exaltation. But here it seems to mean “have the honor or advantage over me” in choosing when to remove the frogs. The LXX has “appoint for me.” Moses is doing more than extending a courtesy to Pharaoh; he is giving him the upper hand in choosing the time. But it is also a test, for if Pharaoh picked the time it would appear less likely that Moses was manipulating things. As U.

So there is the familiar confrontation (vv. 25-29). Pharaoh’s words to Moses are an advancement on his previous words. Now he uses imperatives: “Go, sacrifice to your God.” But he restricts it to “in the [this] land.” This is a subtle attempt to keep them as a subjugated people and prevent their absolute allegiance to their God. This offered compromise would destroy the point of the exodus – to leave Egypt and find a new allegiance under the Lord.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="EXO.8.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content"> But Moses said, “That would not be the right thing to do,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The clause is a little unusual in its formation. The form נָכוֹן (nakhon) is the Niphal participle from כּוּן (kun), which usually means “firm, fixed, steadfast,” but here it has a rare meaning of “right, fitting, appropriate.” It functions in the sentence as the predicate adjective, because the infinitive לַעֲשּׂוֹת (la’asot) is the subject – “to do so is not right.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> for the sacrifices we make</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This translation has been smoothed out to capture the sense.

Cassuto (Exodus, 109) says there are two ways to understand “the abomination of the Egyptians.” One is that the sacrifice of the sacred animals would appear an abominable thing in the eyes of the Egyptians, and the other is that the word “abomination” could be a derogatory term for idols – we sacrifice what is an Egyptian idol. So that is why he says if they did this the Egyptians would stone them.</span></span></span><span class="content"> If we make sacrifices that are an abomination to the Egyptians right before their eyes,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians [or “of Egypt”] before their eyes.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> will they not stone us?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The interrogative clause has no particle to indicate it is a question, but it is connected with the conjunction to the preceding clause, and the meaning of these clauses indicate it is a question (GKC 473 §150.a).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="EXO.8.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content"> We must go</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb נֵלֵךְ (nelekh) is a Qal imperfect of the verb הָלַךְ (halakh).
