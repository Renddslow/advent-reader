They had particular gods to whom they looked for help in such catastrophes. The locust-scaring deities of Greece and Asia were probably looked to in Egypt as well (especially in view of the origins in Egypt of so many of those religious ideas). The announcement of the plague falls into the now-familiar pattern. God tells Moses to go and speak to Pharaoh but reminds Moses that he has hardened his heart. Yahweh explains that he has done this so that he might show his power, so that in turn they might declare his name from generation to generation. This point is stressed so often that it must not be minimized. God was laying the foundation of the faith for Israel – the sovereignty of Yahweh.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> said</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Yahweh said.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, in order to display</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is שִׁתִי (shiti, “I have put”); it is used here as a synonym for the verb שִׂים (sim).

The clause explains an additional reason for God’s hardening the heart of Pharaoh, namely, so that the Israelites can tell their children of God’s great wonders. The expression is highly poetic and intense – like Ps 44:1, which says, “we have heard with our ears.” The emphasis would be on the clear teaching, orally, from one generation to another.</span></span></span><span class="content"> how I made fools</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb הִתְעַלַּלְתִּי (hit’allalti) is a bold anthropomorphism. The word means to occupy oneself at another’s expense, to toy with someone, which may be paraphrased with “mock.” The whole point is that God is shaming and disgracing Egypt, making them look foolish in their arrogance and stubbornness (W. C. Kaiser, Jr., “Exodus,” EBC 2:366-67). Some prefer to translate it as “I have dealt ruthlessly” with Egypt (see U. Cassuto, Exodus, 123).</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the Egyptians</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “of Egypt.” The place is put by metonymy for the inhabitants.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and about</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “about” is supplied to clarify this as another object of the verb “declare.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> my signs that I displayed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “put” or “placed.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> among them, so that you may know</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is the perfect tense with vav consecutive, וִידַעְתֶּם (vida’tem, “and that you might know”). This provides another purpose for God’s dealings with Egypt in the way that he was doing. The form is equal to the imperfect tense with vav (ו) prefixed; it thus parallels the imperfect that began v. 2 – “that you might tell.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> that I am the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.”</span></span></div>

After “how long,” the form may be classified as present perfect (“how long have you refused), for it describes actions begun previously but with the effects continuing. (See GKC 311 §106.g-h). The use of a verb describing a state or condition may also call for a present translation (“how long do you refuse”) that includes past, present, and potentially future, in keeping with the question “how long.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to humble yourself before me?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The clause is built on the use of the infinitive construct to express the direct object of the verb – it answers the question of what Pharaoh was refusing to do. The Niphal infinitive construct (note the elision of the ה [hey] prefix after the preposition [see GKC 139 §51.l]) is from the verb עָנָה (’anah). The verb in this stem would mean “humble oneself.” The question is somewhat rhetorical, since God was not yet through humbling Pharaoh, who would not humble himself. The issue between Yahweh and Pharaoh is deeper than simply whether or not Pharaoh will let the Israelites leave Egypt.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Release my people so that they may serve me! </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="EXO.10.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> But if you refuse to release my people, I am going to bring</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn הִנְנִי (hinni) before the active participle מֵבִיא (mevi’) is the imminent future construction: “I am about to bring” or “I am going to bring” – precisely, “here I am bringing.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> locusts</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn One of the words for “locusts” in the Bible is אַרְבֶּה (’arbeh), which comes from רָבָה (ravah, “to be much, many”).

The meaning of his “wish” is connected to the next clause – as he is releasing them, may God help them. S. R. Driver says that in Pharaoh’s scornful challenge Yahweh is as likely to protect them as Pharaoh is likely to let them go – not at all (Exodus, 80). He is planning to keep the women and children as hostages to force the men to return. U. Cassuto (Exodus, 125) paraphrases it this way: “May the help of your God be as far from you as I am from giving you permission to go forth with your little ones.” The real irony, Cassuto observes, is that in the final analysis he will let them go, and Yahweh will be with them.</span></span></span><span class="content"> if I release you and your dependents!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The context of Moses’ list of young and old, sons and daughters, and the contrast with the word for strong “men” in v. 11 indicates that טַפְּכֶם (tappÿkhem), often translated “little ones” or “children,” refers to dependent people, noncombatants in general.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Watch out!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “see.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Trouble is right in front of you!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “before your face.”sn The “trouble” or “evil” that is before them could refer to the evil that they are devising – the attempt to escape from Egypt. But that does not make much sense in the sentence – why would he tell them to take heed or look out about that? U. Cassuto (Exodus, 126) makes a better suggestion. He argues that Pharaoh is saying, “Don’t push me too far.” The evil, then, would be what Pharaoh was going to do if these men kept making demands on him. This fits the fact that he had them driven out of his court immediately. There could also be here an allusion to Pharaoh’s god Re’, the sun-deity and head of the pantheon; he would be saying that the power of his god would confront them.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EXO.10.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> No!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “not thus.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Go, you men</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word is הַגְּבָרִים (haggÿvarim, “the strong men”), a word different from the more general one that Pharaoh’s servants used (v. 7).

Many English versions have used “Red Sea,” which translates the name that ancient Greeks used: ejruqrav qalavssa (eruqra qalassa). sn The name Red Sea is currently applied to the sea west of the Arabian Peninsula. The northern fingers of this body of water extend along the west and east sides of the Sinai Peninsula and are presently called the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba or the Gulf of Eilat. In ancient times the name applied to a much larger body of water, including the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf (C. Houtman, Exodus, 1:109-10). See also Num 14:25; 21:4; Deut 1:40; 2:1; Judg 11:16; 1 Kgs 9:26; Jer 49:21. The sea was deep enough to drown the entire Egyptian army later (and thus no shallow swamp land). God drives the locusts to their death in the water. He will have the same power over Egyptian soldiers, for he raised up this powerful empire for a purpose and soon will drown them in the sea.

This plague is comparable to the silence in heaven, just prior to the last and terrible plague (Rev 8:1). Here Yahweh is attacking a core Egyptian religious belief as well as portraying what lay before the Egyptians. Throughout the Bible darkness is the symbol of evil, chaos, and judgment. Blindness is one of its manifestations (see Deut 28:27-29). But the plague here is not blindness, or even spiritual blindness, but an awesome darkness from outside (see Joel 2:2; Zeph 1:15). It is particularly significant in that Egypt’s high god was the Sun God. Lord Sun was now being shut down by Lord Yahweh. If Egypt would not let Israel go to worship their God, then Egypt’s god would be darkness. The structure is familiar: the plague, now unannounced (21-23), and then the confrontation with Pharaoh (24-27).</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> said to Moses, “Extend your hand toward heaven</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the sky” (also in the following verse).

This is another application of the antisupernatural approach to these texts. The text, however, is probably describing something that was not a seasonal wind, or Pharaoh would not have been intimidated. If it coincided with that season, then what is described here is so different and so powerful that the Egyptians would have known the difference easily. Pharaoh here would have had to have been impressed that this was something very abnormal, and that his god was powerless.
