B. Jacob (Exodus, 360) explains that vv. 3-16 contain a sermon, in which Moses “began his speech by reminding the people of the events which had just occurred and how they would be recalled by them in the future,” and then he explained the rulings that went along with it. So the first two verses state the core of the sermon, a new command calling for the redeemed (firstborn) to be sanctified. The second portion stresses that God requires the redeemed to remember their redemption by purifying themselves (3-10). The third section (11-16) develops the theme of dedication to Yahweh. The point is that in view of God’s mighty redemption, the redeemed (represented by the firstborn) must be set apart for Yahweh’s service.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> spoke</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Yahweh spoke.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to Moses: </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="EXO.13.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> “Set apart</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb “sanctify” is the Piel imperative of קָדַשׁ (qadash).

The use of this form in place of the imperative (also found in the Decalogue with the Sabbath instruction) stresses the basic meaning of the root word, everything involved with remembering (emphatic imperative, according to GKC 346 §113.bb). The verb usually implies that there will be proper action based on what was remembered.sn There is a pattern in the arrangement of vv. 3-10 and 11-16. Both sections contain commands based on the mighty deliverance as reminders of the deliverance. “With a mighty hand” occurs in vv. 3, 9, 14, 16. An explanation to the son is found in vv. 8 and 14. The emphases “sign on your hand” and “between your eyes” are part of the conclusions to both halves (vv. 9, 16).</span></span></span><span class="content"> this day on which you came out from Egypt, from the place where you were enslaved,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “from a house of slaves.” “House” is obviously not meant to be literal; it indicates a location characterized by slavery, a land of slaves, as if they were in a slave house.

B. Jacob (Exodus, 368), weighing the pros and cons of the literal or the figurative meaning, says that those who took it literally should not be looked down on for their symbolic work. In many cases, he continues, it is the spirit that kills and the letter makes alive – because people who argue against a literal usage do so to excuse lack of action. This is a rather interesting twist in the discussion. The point of the teaching was obviously meant to keep the Law of Yahweh in the minds of the people, to remind them of their duties.</span></span></span><span class="content"> It</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn That is, this ceremony.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will be a sign</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “for a sign.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> for you on your hand and a memorial</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “for a memorial.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> on your forehead,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “between your eyes” (KJV and ASV both similar); the same expression occurs in v. 16.sn That these festivals and consecrations were to be signs and memorials is akin to the expressions used in the book of Proverbs (Prov 3:3, “bind them around your neck…write them on your heart”).

Here the Law said, “you will cause to pass over (וְהַעֲבַרְתָּ, vÿha’avarta) to Yahweh.” The Hiphil perfect with the vav (ו) provides the main clause after the temporal clauses. Yahweh here claimed the firstborn as his own. The remarkable thing about this is that Yahweh did not keep the firstborn that was dedicated to him, but allowed the child to be redeemed by his father. It was an acknowledgment that the life of the child belonged to God as the one redeemed from death, and that the child represented the family. Thus, the observance referred to the dedication of all the redeemed to God.sn It was once assumed by some scholars that child sacrifice lay behind this text in the earlier days, but that the priests and prophets removed those themes. Apart from the fact that there is absolutely no evidence for anything like that, the Law forbade child sacrifice, and always used child sacrifice as the sample of what not to do in conformity with the pagans (e.g., Deut 12:31). Besides, how absurd would it be for Yahweh to redeem the firstborn from death and then ask Israel to kill them. See further B. Jacob, Exodus, 371.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> the first offspring of every womb.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “every opener of a womb,” that is, the firstborn from every womb.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Every firstling</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The descriptive noun שֶׁגֶר (sheger) is related to the verb “drop, cast”; it refers to a newly born animal that is dropped or cast from the womb.

The owner might not redeem the donkey, but if he did not, he could not keep it, he had to kill it by breaking its neck (so either a lamb for it, or the donkey itself). The donkey could not be killed by shedding blood because that would make it a sacrifice, and that was not possible with this kind of animal. See G.

The verb is the simple Hiphil perfect הִקְשָׁה (hiqshah, “he made hard”); the infinitive construct לְשַׁלְּחֵנוּ (lÿshallÿkhenu, “to release us”) could be taken epexegetically, meaning “he made releasing us hard.” But the infinitive more likely gives the purpose or the result after the verb “hardened himself.” The verb is figurative for “be stubborn” or “stubbornly refuse.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to release us, the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of people to the firstborn of animals.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The text uses “man” and “beast.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> That is why I am sacrificing</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The form is the active participle.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> the first male offspring of every womb, but all my firstborn sons I redeem.’ </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="EXO.13.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> It will be for a sign on your hand and for frontlets</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word is טוֹטָפֹת (totafot, “frontlets”).

In the Targum to 2 Sam 1:10 it is an armlet worn by Saul (see S. R. Driver, Exodus, 110).

In the first part eating the unleavened bread recalls the night of deliverance in Egypt, and it calls for purity. In the second part the dedication of the firstborn was an acknowledgment of the deliverance of the firstborn from bondage. They were to remember the deliverance and choose purity; they were to remember the deliverance and choose dedication. The NT will also say, “You are not your own, for you were bought with a price, therefore, glorify God” (1 Cor 6:20). Here too the truths of God’s great redemption must be learned well and retained well from generation to generation.</span></span></span></span></div>

The people there in the earlier period may have been Semites, judging from their names, or they may have been migrants from Crete in the early time. The Philistines after the exodus were of Greek origin. The danger of warfare at this time was clearly with Canaanitish tribes. For further details, see K. A.

S. Childs, Exodus [OTL], 217).sn The translation of this name as “Red Sea” comes from the sea’s Greek name in the LXX and elsewhere. The Red Sea on today’s maps is farther south, below the Sinai Peninsula. But the title Red Sea in ancient times may very well have covered both the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba (see Deut 1:1; 1 Kgs 9:26). The name “Sea of Reeds” in various English versions (usually in the form of a marginal note) and commentaries reflects the meaning of the Hebrew word סוּף a word for reedy water plants (Exod 2:3, 5; Isa 19:6; Jonah 2:6 [Eng. v. 5]) that may have a connection with an Egyptian word used for papyrus and other marsh plants. On this basis some have taken the term Yam Suph as perhaps referring to Lake Menzaleh or Lake Ballah, which have abundant reeds, north of the extension of the Red Sea on the western side of Sinai. Whatever exact body of water is meant, it was not merely a marshy swamp that the people waded through, but a body of water large enough to make passage impossible without divine intervention, and deep enough to drown the Egyptian army. Lake Menzaleh has always been deep enough to preclude passage on foot (E. H. Merrill, Kingdom of Priests, 66). Among the many sources dealing with the geography, see B. F. Batto, “The Reed Sea: Requiescat in Pace,” JBL 102 (1983): 27-35; M. Waxman, “I Miss the Red Sea,” Conservative Judaism 18 (1963): 35-44; G. Coats, “The Sea Tradition in the Wilderness Theme: A Review,” JSOT 12 (1979): 2-8; and K. A.

Unfortunately, it is a rare word with uncertain meaning. Most translations have something to do with “in battle array” or “prepared to fight” if need be (cf. Josh 1:14; 4:12). The Targum took it as “armed with weapons.” The LXX had “in the fifth generation.” Some have opted for “in five divisions.”</span></span></span></span></div>
