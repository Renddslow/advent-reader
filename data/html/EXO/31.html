This chapter would have been the bridge to the building of the sanctuary (35-39) if it were not for the idolatrous interlude. God called individuals and prepared them by his Spirit to be skilled to do the work for the tabernacle. If this were the substance of an exposition, it would clearly be a message on gifted people doing the work – close to the spiritual lesson of Ephesians 4. There would be two levels of meaning: the physical, which looks at the skilled artisans providing for a place to worship Yahweh, and the spiritual, which would bring in the Spirit-filled servants of God participating in building up his kingdom.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> spoke to Moses:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="EXO.31.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> “See, I have chosen</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “called by name.” This expression means that the person was specifically chosen for some important task (S.

The placement of this section here, however, should come as no surprise. After the instructions and preparation for work, a Sabbath day when work could not be done had to be legislated. In all that they were going to do, they must not violate the Sabbath,</span></span></span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> said to Moses,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Yahweh said (אָמַר, ’amar) to Moses, saying.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="EXO.31.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> “Tell the Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep my Sabbaths,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The instruction for the Sabbath at this point seems rather abrupt, but it follows logically the extended plans of building the sanctuary. B. Jacob, following some of the earlier treatments, suggests that these are specific rules given for the duration of the building of the sanctuary (Exodus, 844). The Sabbath day is a day of complete cessation; no labor or work could be done. The point here is that God’s covenant people must faithfully keep the sign of the covenant as a living commemoration of the finished work of Yahweh, and as an active part in their sanctification.

Robinson, “The Idea of Rest in the OT and the Search for the Basic Character of Sabbath,” ZAW 92 (1980): 32-42; M. Tsevat, “The Basic Meaning of the Biblical Sabbath, ZAW 84 (1972): 447-59; M. T.

This form serves as the subject of the sentence. The word חָלַל (khalal) is the antonym of קָדַשׁ (qadash, “to be holy”). It means “common, profane,” and in the Piel stem “make common, profane” or “defile.” Treating the Sabbath like an ordinary day would profane it, make it common.</span></span></span><span class="content"> must surely be put to death; indeed,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This is the asseverative use of כִּי (ki) meaning “surely, indeed,” for it restates the point just made (see R.

Cassuto, Exodus, 404). The second noun, the modifying genitive, is an abstract noun. The repetition provides the superlative idea that complete rest is the order of the day.</span></span></span><span class="content"> holy to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">; anyone who does work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="EXO.31.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> The Israelites must keep the Sabbath by observing the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="EXO.31.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever; for in six days</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The expression again forms an adverbial accusative of time.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The word “rest” essentially means “to cease, stop.” So describing God as “resting” on the seventh day does not indicate that he was tired – he simply finished creation and then ceased or stopped. But in this verse is a very bold anthropomorphism in the form of the verb וַיִּנָּפַשׁ (vayyinnafash), a Niphal preterite from the root נָפַשׁ (nafash), the word that is related to “life, soul” or more specifically “breath, throat.” The verb is usually translated here as “he was refreshed,” offering a very human picture. It could also be rendered “he took breath” (S. R. Driver, Exodus, 345). Elsewhere the verb is used of people and animals. The anthropomorphism is clearly intended to teach people to stop and refresh themselves physically, spiritually, and emotionally on this day of rest.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="EXO.31.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> He gave Moses two tablets of testimony when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, tablets of stone written by the finger of God.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The expression “the finger of God” has come up before in the book, in the plagues (Exod 8:15) to express that it was a demonstration of the power and authority of God. So here too the commandments given to Moses on stone tablets came from God. It too is a bold anthropomorphism; to attribute such a material action to Yahweh would have been thought provoking to say the least. But by using “God” and by stating it in an obviously figurative way, balance is maintained. Since no one writes with one finger, the expression simply says that the Law came directly from God.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>
