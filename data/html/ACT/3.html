The external testimony is thus fairly evenly divided, with few but important representatives of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes supporting the shorter reading. Internally, the words look like a standard scribal emendation, and may have been motivated by other healing passages where Jesus gave a similar double command (cf. Matt 9:5; Mark 2:9, [11]; Luke 5:23; [6:8]; John 5:8). On the other hand, there is some motivation for deleting ἔγειρε καί here, namely, unlike Jesus’ healing miracles, Peter raises (ἤγειρεν, hgeiren) the man to his feet (v. 7) rather than the man rising on his own. In light of the scribal tendency to harmonize, especially in immediate context, the longer reading is slightly preferred.</span></span></span><span class="content"> walk!” </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="ACT.3.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> Then</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “Then” to reflect the sequence of events.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Peter</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he”; the referent (Peter) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> took hold</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Peter taking hold of him…raised him up.” The participle πιάσας (piasas) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of him by the right hand and raised him up, and at once the man’s</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “his”; the referent (the man) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> feet and ankles were made strong.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn At once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong.

In light of the context of the OT quotation, it is better to translate πατριά as “nations” here.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">of the earth will be blessed</span></span></span><span class="content">.’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Gen 22:18.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="ACT.3.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content"> God raised up</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “God raising up his servant, sent him.” The participle ἀναστήσας (anasthsa&quot;) has been translated as a finite verb due to requirements of contemporary English style.
