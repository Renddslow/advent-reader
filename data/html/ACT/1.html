The Greek term πρῶτος (prwtos) does not necessarily mean “first” in an absolute sense, but can refer to the first in a set or series. That is what is intended here – the first account (known as the Gospel of Luke) as compared to the second one (known as Acts).</span></span></span><span class="content"> account,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek word λόγος (logos) is sometimes translated “book” (NRSV, NIV) or “treatise” (KJV). A formal, systematic treatment of a subject is implied, but the word “book” may be too specific and slightly misleading to the modern reader, so “account” has been used.sn The former account refers to the Gospel of Luke, which was “volume one” of the two-volume work Luke-Acts.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Theophilus,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “O Theophilus,” but the usage of the vocative in Acts with ὦ (w) is unemphatic, following more the classical idiom (see ExSyn 69).</span></span></span><span class="content"> about all that Jesus began to do and teach </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ACT.1.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> until the day he was taken up to heaven,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “to heaven” are not in the Greek text, but are supplied from v. 11. Several modern translations (NIV, NRSV) supply the words “to heaven” after “taken up” to specify the destination explicitly mentioned later in 1:11.</span></span></span><span class="content"> after he had given orders</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “commands.” Although some modern translations render ἐντειλάμενος (enteilameno&quot;) as “instructions” (NIV, NRSV), the word implies authority or official sanction (G. Schrenk, TDNT 2:545), so that a word like “orders” conveys the idea more effectively. The action of the temporal participle is antecedent (prior) to the action of the verb it modifies (“taken up”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> by</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “through.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="ACT.1.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> To the same apostles</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to them”; the referent (the apostles) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> also, after his suffering,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn After his suffering is a reference to Jesus’ crucifixion and the abuse which preceded it.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he presented himself alive with many convincing proofs.

The difficulty with the first option is that it does not fit the context, and this meaning is not found elsewhere. The second option is difficult because of the singular number and the present tense. The third option is based on a spelling variation of συναυλιζόμενος (sunaulizomeno&quot;), which some minuscules actually read here. The difference in meaning between (2) and (3) is not great, but (3) seems to fit the context somewhat better here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he declared,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “ordered them”; the command “Do not leave” is not in Greek but is an indirect quotation in the original (see note at end of the verse for explanation).</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Do not leave Jerusalem,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</span></span></span><span class="content"> but wait there</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “there” is not in the Greek text (direct objects in Greek were frequently omitted when clear from the context).</span></span></span><span class="content"> for what my</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the,” with the article used as a possessive pronoun (ExSyn 215).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Father promised,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “for the promise of the Father.” Jesus is referring to the promised gift of the Holy Spirit (see the following verse).</span></span></span><span class="content"> which you heard about from me.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “While he was with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for ‘what my Father promised, which you heard about from me.’” This verse moves from indirect to direct discourse.
