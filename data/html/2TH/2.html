Although external support for ἁμαρτίας is broader, the generally earlier and better witnesses are on the side of ἀνομίας. Internally, since ἁμαρτία (Jamartia, “sin”) occurs nearly ten times as often as ἀνομία (anomia, “lawlessness”) in the corpus Paulinum, scribes would be expected to change the text to the more familiar term. At the same time, the mention of ἀνομία in v. 7 and ὁ ἄνομος (Jo anomo&quot;, “the lawless one”) in v. 8, both of which look back to v. 3, may have prompted scribes to change the text toward ἀνομίας. The internal evidence is thus fairly evenly balanced. Although a decision is difficult, ἀνομίας has slightly greater probability of authenticity than ἁμαρτίας.</span></span></span><span class="content"> is revealed, the son of destruction.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the one destined for destruction.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="2TH.2.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> He</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the one who opposes,” describing the figure in v. 3.

The restraint can be spoken of as a force or as a person. Some have taken this to mean the Roman Empire in particular or human government in general, since these are forces that can also be seen embodied in a person, the emperor or governing head. But apocalyptic texts like Revelation and Daniel portray human government of the end times as under Satanic control, not holding back his influence. Also the power to hold back Satanic forces can only come from God. So others understand this restraint to be some force from God: the preaching of the gospel or the working of the Holy Spirit through God’s people.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will do so until he is taken out of the way, </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="2TH.2.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc ‡ Several important witnesses of the Alexandrian and Western traditions, as well as many other witnesses, read ᾿Ιησοῦς (Ihsous, “Jesus”) after κύριος (kurios, “Lord”; so א A D* F G Lc P Ψ 0278 33 81 104 365 1241 2464 pc latt sy co). But there is sufficient evidence in the Alexandrian tradition for the shorter reading (B 1739 1881), supported by the Byzantine text as well as Irenaeus. Although it is possible that scribes overlooked ᾿Ιησοῦς if the two nomina sacra occurred together (kMsiMs), since “the Lord Jesus” is a frequent enough appellation, it looks to be a motivated reading. NA27 places ᾿Ιησοῦς in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will destroy by the breath of his mouth and wipe out by the manifestation of his arrival. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="2TH.2.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> The arrival of the lawless one</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “whose coming,” referring to the lawless one.

But Paul would not be likely to call the Thessalonians “the first fruits” among his converts. Further, ἀπαρχή (aparch, “first fruit”) is a well-worn term in Paul’s letters (Rom 8:23; 11:16; 16:5; 1 Cor 15:20, 23; 16:15), while ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς occurs nowhere else in Paul. Scribes might be expected to change the text to the more familiar term.
