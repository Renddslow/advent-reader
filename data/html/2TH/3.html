In the NT it occurs 15 times: 3 times as ῥῆμα τοῦ κυρίου (rJhma tou kuriou; Luke 22:61, Acts 11:16, 1 Pet 1:25) and 12 times as λόγος τοῦ κυρίου (logo&quot; tou kuriou; here and in Acts 8:25; 13:44, 48, 49; 15:35, 36; 16:32; 19:10, 20; 1 Thess 1:8, 4:15). As in the OT, this phrase focuses on the prophetic nature and divine origin of what has been said. Here the phrase has been translated “the Lord’s message” because of the focus upon the spread of the gospel evident in the passage.</span></span></span><span class="content"> may spread quickly and be honored</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “may run and be glorified.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> as in fact it was among you, </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="2TH.3.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> and that we may be delivered from perverse and evil people.

Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see ExSyn 119-21; M. Zerwick, Biblical Greek, §§36-39).

The reading “they received” is found in two different forms: παρελάβοσαν (parelabosan; in א* A [D*] 0278 33 pc) and παρέλαβον (parelabon; in א2 D2 Ψ 1739 1881 Ï). (παρέλαβον is evidently a correction of παρελάβοσαν to the more common spelling for the third person aorist form). The external evidence is divided fairly evenly, with παρελάβετε and παρελάβοσαν each having adequate support. Internal evidence leans toward “they received”: Given the second person reading, there is little reason why scribes would intentionally change it to a third person plural, and especially an archaic form at that. There is ample reason, however, for scribes to change the third person form to the second person form given that in the prior context παράδοσις (paradosis, “tradition”) is used with a relative clause (as here) with a second person verb (see 2:15). The third person form should be regarded as original.</span></span></span><span class="content"> received from us. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="2TH.3.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> For you know yourselves how you must imitate us, because we did not behave without discipline</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This is the verbal form of the words occurring in vv. 6 and 11, meaning “to act out of line, in an unruly way.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> among you, </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="2TH.3.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> and we did not eat anyone’s food without paying.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “we did not eat bread freely from anyone.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Instead, in toil and drudgery we worked</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “but working,” as a continuation of the previous sentence.

But Paul took up the pen and wrote vv. 17-18 personally to authenticate that it was his (how I write in every letter). See similar indications in 1 Cor 16:21; Gal 6:11; and Col 4:18.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="2TH.3.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Most witnesses, including some early and important ones (א2 A D F G Ψ Ï lat sy), conclude this letter with ἀμήν (amhn, “amen”). Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding ἀμήν in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, ἀμήν is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the witnesses for the omission are among the best mss (א* B 0278 6 33 1739 1881* 2464 sa), giving sufficient base to prefer the shorter reading.</span></span></span></span></div>
