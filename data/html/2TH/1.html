The omission of the pronoun (the reading of B D P 0111vid 33 1739 1881 pc) seems to be the original wording of this salutation. As well, the intrinsic evidence also supports the shorter reading: If 2 Thessalonians is authentic, it was one of Paul’s earliest letters, and, if so, his stereotyped salutation was still in embryonic form (see discussion at 1 Thess 1:1). NA27 places the word in brackets, indicating some doubts as to its authenticity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! </span></span></div>
