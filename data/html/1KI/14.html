Certainly the Lord gave Ahijah a specific message to give to Jeroboam’s wife (see vv. 6-16), but the author of Kings here condenses the Lord’s message with the words “so-and-so.” For dramatic effect he prefers to have us hear the message from Ahijah’s lips as he speaks to the king’s wife.</span></span></span><span class="content"> When she comes, she will be in a disguise.” </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1KI.14.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> When Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come on in, wife of Jeroboam!

In the Hebrew text vv. 7-11 are one long sentence comprised of a causal clause giving the reason for divine punishment (vv. 7-9) and the main clause announcing the punishment (vv. 10-11).

There is a wordplay in the Hebrew text. The word translated “disaster” (רָעָה, ra’ah) is from the same root as the expression “you have sinned” in v. 9 (וַתָּרַע [vattara’], from רָעַע, [ra’a’]).

For various options see HALOT 871 s.v. עצר 6 and M. Cogan and H. Tadmor, II Kings (AB), 107. The two terms are usually taken as polar opposites (“slaves and freemen” or “minors and adults”), but Cogan and Tadmor, on the basis of contextual considerations (note the usage with אֶפֶס [’efes], “nothing but”) in Deut 32:36 and 2 Kgs 14:26, argue convincingly that the terms are synonyms, meaning “restrained and abandoned,” and refer to incapable or incapacitated individuals.</span></span></span><span class="content"> I will burn up the dynasty of Jeroboam, just as one burns manure until it is completely consumed.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The traditional view understands the verb בָּעַר (ba’ar) to mean “burn.” Manure was sometimes used as fuel (see Ezek 4:12, 15). However, an alternate view takes בָּעַר as a homonym meaning “sweep away” (HALOT 146 s.v. II בער). In this case one might translate, “I will sweep away the dynasty of Jeroboam, just as one sweeps away manure it is gone” (cf. ASV, NASB, TEV). Either metaphor emphasizes the thorough and destructive nature of the coming judgment.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="1KI.14.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> Dogs will eat the members of your family</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew text has “belonging to Jeroboam” here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who die in the city, and the birds of the sky will eat the ones who die in the country.”’ Indeed, the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has announced it!</span></span></div>

She was commonly worshiped at shrines in or near groves of evergreen trees, or, failing that, at places marked by wooden poles.
