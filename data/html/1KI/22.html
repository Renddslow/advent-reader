Micaiah’s actions became understandable later, when it is revealed that the Lord desires to deceive the king and lead him to his demise. The Lord even dispatches a lying spirit to deceive Ahab’s prophets. Micaiah can lie to the king because he realizes this lie is from the Lord. It is important to note that in v. 14 Micaiah only vows to speak the word of the Lord; he does not necessarily say he will tell the truth. In this case the Lord’s word itself is deceptive. Only when the king adjures him to tell the truth (v. 16), does Micaiah do so.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="1KI.22.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> The king said to him, “How many times must I make you solemnly promise in</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “swear an oath by.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the name of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> to tell me only the truth?” </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="1KI.22.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> Micaiah</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent (Micaiah) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep that have no shepherd.

It is certainly possible, and probably even likely, that the article is used in a generic or dramatic sense and should be translated, “a spirit.” In the latter case it would show that this spirit was vivid and definite in the mind of Micaiah the storyteller. However, if one insists that the article indicates a well-known or universally known spirit, the following context provides a likely referent. Verse 24 tells how Zedekiah slapped Micaiah in the face and then asked sarcastically, “Which way did the spirit from the Lord (רוּחַ־יְהוָה, [ruakh-Yahweh], Heb “the spirit of the Lord”) go when he went from me to speak to you?” When the phrase “the spirit of the Lord” refers to the divine spirit (rather than the divine breath or mind, Isa 40:7, 13) elsewhere, the spirit energizes an individual or group for special tasks or moves one to prophesy. This raises the possibility that the deceiving spirit of vv. 20-23 is the same as the divine spirit mentioned by Zedekiah in v. 24. This would explain why the article is used on רוּחַ; he can be called “the spirit” because he is the well-known spirit who energizes the prophets.</span></span></span><span class="content"> stepped forward and stood before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.
