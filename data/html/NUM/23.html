Based on that vision, and the Lord’s word, he announces the uniqueness of Israel – they are not just like one of the other nations.

The editor of BHS prefers this reading.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the fourth part of Israel? </span></span></div>

The nuance of the imperfect tense would be obligatory: “I must be careful” – to do what? to speak what the Lord has put in my mouth. The infinitive construct “to speak” is therefore serving as the direct object of שָׁמַר.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to speak what the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has put in my mouth?”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The clause is a noun clause serving as the direct object of “to speak.” It begins with the sign of the accusative, and then the relative pronoun that indicates the whole clause is the accusative.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="NUM.23.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you can observe them.

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="NUM.23.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content"> Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is preceded by the infinitive absolute: “you shall by no means curse” or “do not curse them at all.” He brought him to curse, and when he tried to curse there was a blessing. Balak can only say it would be better not to bother.</span></span></span><span class="content"> nor bless them at all!”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The same construction now works with “nor bless them at all.” The two together form a merism – “don’t say anything.” He does not want them blessed, so Balaam is not to do that, but the curse isn’t working either.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="NUM.23.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content"> But Balaam replied</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “answered and said.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘All that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> speaks,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This first clause, “all that the Lord speaks” – is a noun clause functioning as the object of the verb that comes at the end of the verse. It is something of an independent accusative case, since it is picked up with the sign of the accusative: “all that the Lord speaks, it I must do.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> I must do’?”</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="NUM.23.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content"> Balak said to Balaam, “Come, please; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “be pleasing in the eyes of God.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to let you curse them for me from there.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Balak is stubborn, as indeed Balaam is persistent. But Balak still thinks that if another location were used it just might work. Balaam had actually told Balak in the prophecy that other attempts would fail. But Balak refuses to give up so easily. So he insists they perform the ritual and try again. This time, however, Balaam will change his approach, and this will result in a dramatic outpouring of power on him.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="NUM.23.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content"> So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward the wilderness.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or perhaps as a place name, “Jeshimon” (cf. 21:20).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="NUM.23.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content"> Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams.” </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="NUM.23.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content"> So Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. </span></span></div>
