In the overall plan of the book, here we have another possible threat to God’s program, although here it comes from within the camp (Balaam was the threat from without). If the Moabites could not defeat them one way, they would try another. The chapter has three parts: fornication (vv. 1-3), God’s punishment (vv. 4-9), and aftermath (vv. 10-18). See further G. E. Mendenhall, The Tenth Generation, 105-21; and S. C. Reif, “What Enraged Phinehas? A Study of Numbers 25:8,” JBL 90 (1971): 200-206.</span></span></span><span class="content"> When</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This first preterite is subordinated to the next as a temporal clause; it is not giving a parallel action, but the setting for the event.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Israel lived in Shittim, the people began to commit sexual immorality</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The account apparently means that the men were having sex with the Moabite women. Why the men submitted to such a temptation at this point is hard to say. It may be that as military heroes the men took liberties with the women of occupied territories.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with the daughters of Moab. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="NUM.25.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> These women invited</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb simply says “they called,” but it is a feminine plural. And so the women who engaged in immoral acts with Hebrew men invited them to their temple ritual.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the people to the sacrifices of their gods; then the people ate and bowed down to their gods.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn What Israel experienced here was some of the debased ritual practices of the Canaanite people. The act of prostrating themselves before the pagan deities was probably participation in a fertility ritual, nothing short of cultic prostitution. This was a blatant disregard of the covenant and the Law. If something were not done, the nation would have destroyed itself.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="NUM.25.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> When Israel joined themselves to Baal-peor,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is “yoked” to Baal-peor. The word is unusual, and may suggest the physical, ritual participation described below. It certainly shows that they acknowledge the reality of the local god.sn The evidence indicates that Moab was part of the very corrupt Canaanite world, a world that was given over to the fertility ritual of the times.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the anger of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> flared up against Israel. </span></span></div>

They were responsible for the tribes’ conformity to the Law, but here they had not only failed in their duty, but had participated. The leaders were executed; the rest of the guilty died by the plague.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the people, and hang them up</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The leaders who were guilty were commanded by God to be publicly exposed by hanging, probably a reference to impaling, but possibly some other form of harsh punishment. The point was that the swaying of their executed bodies would be a startling warning for any who so blatantly set the Law aside and indulged in apostasy through pagan sexual orgies.</span></span></span><span class="content"> before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> in broad daylight,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in the sun.” This means in broad daylight.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that the fierce anger of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> may be turned away from Israel.” </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="NUM.25.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you must execute those of his men</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “slay – a man his men.” The imperative is plural, and so “man” is to be taken collectively as “each of you men.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> who were joined to Baal-peor.”</span></span></div>

Some suggest it was in the tabernacle area, but that is unlikely. S. C. Reif argues for a private tent shrine (“What Enraged Phinehas? A Study of Numbers 25:8,” JBL 90 [1971]: 200-206).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and thrust through the Israelite man and into the woman’s abdomen.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he thrust the two of them the Israelite man and the woman to her belly [lower abdomen].” Reif notes the similarity of the word with the previous “inner tent,” and suggests that it means Phinehas stabbed her in her shrine tent, where she was being set up as some sort of priestess or cult leader. Phinehas put a quick end to their sexual immorality while they were in the act.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So the plague was stopped from the Israelites.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Phinehas saw all this as part of the pagan sexual ritual that was defiling the camp. He had seen that the Lord himself had had the guilty put to death. And there was already some plague breaking out in the camp that had to be stopped. And so in his zeal he dramatically put an end to this incident, that served to stop the rest and end the plague.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="NUM.25.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> Those that died in the plague were 24,000.</span></span></div>

The word “zeal” means a passionate intensity to protect or preserve divine or social institutions.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for my sake among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in my zeal.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word for “zeal” now occurs a third time. While some English versions translate this word here as “jealousy” (KJV, ASV, NASB, NRSV), it carries the force of God’s passionate determination to defend his rights and what is right about the covenant and the community and parallels the “zeal” that Phinehas had just demonstrated.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="NUM.25.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Therefore, announce:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “say.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> ‘I am going to give</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here too the grammar expresses an imminent future by using the particle הִנְנִי (hinni) before the participle נֹתֵן (noten) – “here I am giving,” or “I am about to give.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to him my covenant of peace.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “my pledge of friendship” (NAB), or “my pact of friendship” (NJPS). This is the designation of the leadership of the priestly ministry.

Phinehas was passionately determined to maintain the rights of his God by stopping the gross sinful perversions.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and has made atonement</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The atonement that he made in this passage refers to the killing of the two obviously blatant sinners. By doing this he dispensed with any animal sacrifice, for the sinners themselves died. In Leviticus it was the life of the substitutionary animal that was taken in place of the sinners that made atonement. The point is that sin was punished by death, and so God was free to end the plague and pardon the people. God’s holiness and righteousness have always been every bit as important as God’s mercy and compassion, for without righteousness and holiness mercy and compassion mean nothing.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for the Israelites.’”</span></span></div>

The judgment was swift and severe, because the crime was so great, and the danger of it spreading was certain. Paul refers to this horrible incident when he reminds Christians not to do similar things (1 Cor 10:6-8).</span></span></span></span></div>
