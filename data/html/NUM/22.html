It is hard to determine how long they were in Transjordan, but a good amount of time must have elapsed for the number of moves they made and the wars they fought. There is a considerable amount of information available on this section of the book. Some of the most helpful works include: H. C. Brichto, The Problem of “Curse” in the Hebrew Bible (JBLMS); E. Burrows, The Oracles of Jacob and Balaam; G. W. Coats, “Balaam, Sinner or Saint?” BR 18 (1973): 21-29; P. C. Craigie, “The Conquest and Early Hebrew Poetry,” TynBul 20 (1969): 76-94; I. Parker, “The Way of God and the Way of Balaam,” ExpTim 17 (1905): 45; and J. A. Wharton, “The Command to Bless: An Exposition of Numbers 22:41–23:25,” Int 13 (1959): 37-48. This first part introduces the characters and sets the stage for the oracles. It can be divided into four sections: the invitation declined (vv. 1-14), the second invitation extended (vv. 15-21), God opposes Balaam (vv. 22-35), and Balaam meets Balak (vv. 36-41).</span></span></span><span class="content"> The Israelites traveled on</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verse begins with the vav (ו) consecutive.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and camped in the plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan River</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “River” is not in the Hebrew text, but has been supplied in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> across from Jericho.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For the location of Jericho see Map5-B2; Map6-E1; Map7-E1; Map8-E3; Map10-A2; Map11-A1.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="NUM.22.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Balak son of Zippor saw all that the Israelites had done to the Amorites. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="NUM.22.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> And the Moabites were greatly afraid of the people, because they were so numerous.

Balaam appears to be a pagan diviner who was of some reputation; he was called to curse the Israelites, but God intervened and gave him blessings only. The passage forms a nice complement to texts that deal with blessings and curses. It shows that no one can curse someone whom God has blessed.</span></span></span><span class="content"> son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates River</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “by the river”; in most contexts this expression refers to the Euphrates River (cf.
