The MT apparently suffers from parablepsis, whereby a scribe’s eye jumped from the first occurrence of the expression “the Lord has anointed you” to the second occurrence of this expression at the end of v. 1. This mistake caused the accidental omission of the intervening material in the LXX, which appears to preserve the original Hebrew text here.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="1SA.10.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> When you leave me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb at Zelzah on Benjamin’s border.
