It is not necessary to read “with us,” rather than the MT “with me,” although the plural can be found here in a few medieval Hebrew mss. See also the LXX, Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate, although these versions may simply reflect an understanding of the idiom as found in the MT rather than a different textual reading.</span></span></span><span class="content"> we won’t give them any of the loot we retrieved!

The present translation accepts the text as found in the MT and understands this clause to be elliptical, with an understood verb such as “look” or “consider.” On the other hand, the LXX seems to reflect a slightly different Hebrew text, reading “after” where the MT has “my brothers.” The Greek translation yields the following translation: “You should not do this after the Lord has delivered us.” Although the Greek reading should be taken seriously, it seems better to follow the MT here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> He has protected us and has delivered into our hands the raiding party that came against us. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="1SA.30.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content"> Who will listen to you in this matter?
