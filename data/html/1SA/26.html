         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="1SA.26.2"><span class="content">went down to the desert of Ziph, accompanied by three thousand select men of Israel, to look for David in the desert of Ziph. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="1SA.26.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah near Jeshimon, but David was staying in the desert. When he realized that Saul had come to the desert to find</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “after.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> him, </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="1SA.26.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> David sent scouts and verified that Saul had indeed arrived.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and David sent scouts and he knew that Saul had certainly come.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1SA.26.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> So David set out and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general in command of his army, were sleeping. Now Saul was lying in the entrenchment, and the army was camped all around him. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1SA.26.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” Abishai replied, “I will go down with you.”</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1SA.26.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> So David and Abishai approached the army at night and found Saul lying asleep in the entrenchment with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the army were lying all around him. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1SA.26.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me drive the spear</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here “the spear” almost certainly refers to Saul’s own spear, which according to the previous verse was stuck into the ground beside him as he slept. This is reflected in a number of English versions: TEV, CEV “his own spear”; NLT “that spear.” Cf. NIV, NCV “my spear,” in which case Abishai refers to his own spear rather than Saul’s, but this is unlikely since (1) Abishai would probably not have carried a spear along since such a weapon would be unwieldy when sneaking into the enemy camp; and (2) this would not explain the mention of Saul’s own spear stuck in the ground beside him in the previous verse.</span></span></span><span class="content"> right through him into the ground with one swift jab!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “let me strike him with the spear and into the ground one time.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> A second jab won’t be necessary!” </span></span></div>

Either his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and be swept away. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="1SA.26.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> But may the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> prevent me from extending my hand against the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s chosen one!

After all, who is like you in Israel? Why then haven’t you protected your lord the king? One of the soldiers came to kill your lord the king. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="1SA.26.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> This failure on your part isn’t good!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Not good [is] this thing which you have done.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> As surely as the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> lives, you people who have not protected your lord, the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s chosen one, are as good as dead!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “you are sons of death.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Now look where the king’s spear and the jug of water that was by his head are!”</span></span></div>
