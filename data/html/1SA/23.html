The use of this verb in Jer 19:4 is somewhat parallel, but not entirely so. Many scholars have therefore suspected a textual problem here, emending the word נִכַּר (nikkar, “alienated”) to סִכַּר (sikkar, “he has shut up [i.e., delivered]”). This is the idea reflected in the translations of the Syriac Peshitta and Vulgate, although it is not entirely clear whether they are reading something different from the MT or are simply paraphrasing what for them too may have been a difficult text. The LXX has “God has sold him into my hands,” apparently reading מַכַר (makar, “sold”) for MT’s נִכַּר. The present translation is a rather free interpretation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> him into my hand, for he has boxed himself into a corner by entering a city with two barred gates.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “with two gates and a bar.” Since in English “bar” could be understood as a saloon, it has been translated as an attributive: “two barred gates.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1SA.23.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> So Saul mustered all his army to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “So Saul mustered all his army for battle to go down to Keilah to besiege against David and his men.”</span></span></span></span></div>

However, there is another root I חלק, which means “to be smooth or slippery” (HALOT 322 s.v. I חלק).
