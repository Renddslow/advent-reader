This verb normally means “to leave,” “to forsake,” or “to permit,” but such an idea does not fit this context very well. Many scholars have suspected that the text originally read either וַתֵּט (vattet, “and it spread out”), from the root נטה (nth), or וַתִּקֶשׁ (vattiqesh, “and it grew fierce”), from the root קשׂה (qsh). The former suggestion is apparently supported by the LXX ἔκλινεν (eklinen, “it inclined”) and is adopted in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Israel was defeated by</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “before.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the Philistines, who</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Philistines, and they killed.” The pronoun “they” has been translated as a relative pronoun (“who”) to make it clear to the English reader that the Philistines were the ones who did the killing.</span></span></span><span class="content"> killed about four thousand men in the battle line in the field.</span></span></div>
