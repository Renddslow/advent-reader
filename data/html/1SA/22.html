However, the LXX, the Syriac Peshitta, and Vulgate all have “and.” A conjunction rather than a preposition should probably be read on the front of this phrase.</span></span></span><span class="content"> commanders and officers?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “officers of a thousand and officers of a hundred.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1SA.22.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> For all of you have conspired against me!
