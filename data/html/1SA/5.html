So they took Dagon and set him back in his place. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="1SA.5.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> But when they got up early the following day, Dagon was again lying on the ground before the ark of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">. The head of Dagon and his two hands were sheared off and were lying at the threshold. Only Dagon’s body was left intact.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Heb “only Dagon was left.” We should probably read the word גֵּו (gev, “back”) before Dagon, understanding it to have the sense of the similar word גְּוִיָּה (gÿviyyah, “body”). This variant is supported by the following evidence: The LXX has ἡ ῥάχις (Jh rJacis, “the back” or “trunk”); the Syriac Peshitta has wegusmeh (“and the body of”); the Targum has gupyeh (“the body of”); the Vulgate has truncus (“the trunk of,” cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV, NLT). On the strength of this evidence the present translation employs the phrase “Dagon’s body.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1SA.5.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> (For this reason, to this very day, neither Dagon’s priests nor anyone else who enters Dagon’s temple step on Dagon’s threshold in Ashdod.) </span></span></div>
