BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.sn Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord’s “slave” or “servant” is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For someone who was Jewish this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were “servants (or slaves) of the Lord.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Christ Jesus,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Many important mss, as well as several others (Ì26 א A G Ψ 33 1739 1881 Ï), have a reversed order of these words and read “Jesus Christ” rather than “Christ Jesus” (Ì10 B 81 pc). The meaning is not affected in either case, but the reading “Christ Jesus” is preferred as slightly more difficult and thus more likely the original (a scribe who found it would be prone to change it to the more common expression). At the same time, Paul is fond of the order “Christ Jesus,” especially in certain letters such as Romans, Galatians, and Philippians. As well, the later Pauline letters almost uniformly use this order in the salutations. A decision is difficult, but “Christ Jesus” is slightly preferred.</span></span></span><span class="content"> called to be an apostle,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “a called apostle.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> set apart for the gospel of God.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The genitive in the phrase εὐαγγέλιον θεοῦ (euangelion qeou, “the gospel of God”) could be translated as (1) a subjective genitive (“the gospel which God brings”) or (2) an objective genitive (“the gospel about God”). Either is grammatically possible. This is possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see ExSyn 119-21; M. Zerwick, Biblical Greek, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The gospel which God brings is in fact the gospel about himself. However, in view of God’s action in v. 2 concerning this gospel, a subjective genitive notion (“the gospel which God brings”) is slightly preferred.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ROM.1.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> This gospel</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the gospel of God, which he promised.” Because of the length and complexity of this sentence in Greek, it was divided into shorter English sentences in keeping with contemporary English style.

This phrase implies that Jesus was more than human; otherwise it would have been sufficient to say that he was a descendant of David, cf. L.

Most translations render the Greek participle ὁρισθέντος (Jorisqentos, from ὁρίζω, Jorizw) “declared” or “designated” in order to avoid the possible interpretation that Jesus was appointed the Son of God by the resurrection. However, the Greek term ὁρίζω is used eight times in the NT, and it always has the meaning “to determine, appoint.” Paul is not saying that Jesus was appointed the “Son of God by the resurrection” but “Son-of-God-in-power by the resurrection,” as indicated by the hyphenation. He was born in weakness in human flesh (with respect to the flesh, v. 3) and he was raised with power. This is similar to Matt 28:18 where Jesus told his disciples after the resurrection, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> according to the Holy Spirit</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “spirit of holiness.” Some interpreters take the phrase to refer to Christ’s own inner spirit, which was characterized by holiness.</span></span></span><span class="content"> by the resurrection</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “by his resurrection.” Most interpreters see this as a reference to Jesus’ own resurrection, although some take it to refer to the general resurrection at the end of the age, of which Jesus’ resurrection is the first installment (cf. 1 Cor 15:23).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ROM.1.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Through him</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “through whom.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> we have received grace and our apostleship</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Some interpreters understand the phrase “grace and apostleship” as a hendiadys, translating “grace [i.e., gift] of apostleship.” The pronoun “our” is supplied in the translation to clarify the sense of the statement.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to bring about the obedience</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “and apostleship for obedience.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of faith</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase ὑπακοὴν πίστεως has been variously understood as (1) an objective genitive (a reference to the Christian faith, “obedience to [the] faith”); (2) a subjective genitive (“the obedience faith produces [or requires]”); (3) an attributive genitive (“believing obedience”); or (4) as a genitive of apposition (“obedience, [namely] faith”) in which “faith” further defines “obedience.” These options are discussed by C. E. B. Cranfield, Romans (ICC), 1:66. Others take the phrase as deliberately ambiguous; see D. B. Garlington, “The Obedience of Faith in the Letter to the Romans: Part I: The Meaning of ὑπακοὴ πίστεως (Rom 1:5; 16:26),” WTJ 52 (1990): 201-24.</span></span></span><span class="content"> among all the Gentiles on behalf of his name. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="ROM.1.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> You also are among them,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “among whom you also are called.” Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation. The NIV, with its translation “And you also are among those who are called,” takes the phrase ἐν οἳς ἐστε to refer to the following clause rather than the preceding, so that the addressees of the letter (“you also”) are not connected with “all the Gentiles” mentioned at the end of v. 5. It is more likely, however, that the relative pronoun οἳς has τοῖς ἔθνεσιν as its antecedent, which would indicate that the church at Rome was predominantly Gentile.</span></span></span><span class="content"> called to belong to Jesus Christ.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “called of Jesus Christ.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="ROM.1.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> To all those loved by God in Rome,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see JP4-A1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> called to be saints:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Although the first part of v. 7 is not a complete English sentence, it maintains the “From…to” pattern used in all the Pauline letters to indicate the sender and the recipients.

Instead, this is either a metonymy of cause for effect (Paul will use his own spiritual gifts to edify the Romans), or it simply means something akin to a blessing or benefit in the spiritual realm.

(2) Others see the “righteousness” as God’s act or declaration that makes righteous (i.e., justifies) those who turn to him in faith, taking the genitive “of God” as a subjective genitive (see E. Käsemann, Romans, 25-30).
