There have been several major approaches to the chapter and the group(s) it refers to: (1) Rom 2:14 refers to Gentile Christians, not Gentiles who obey the Jewish law. (2) Paul in Rom 2 is presenting a hypothetical viewpoint: If anyone could obey the law, that person would be justified, but no one can. (3) The reference to “the ones who do the law” in 2:13 are those who “do” the law in the right way, on the basis of faith, not according to Jewish legalism. (4) Rom 2:13 only speaks about Christians being judged in the future, along with such texts as Rom 14:10 and 2 Cor 5:10. (5) Paul’s material in Rom 2 is drawn heavily from Diaspora Judaism, so that the treatment of the law presented here cannot be harmonized with other things Paul says about the law elsewhere (E. P. Sanders, Paul, the Law, and the Jewish People, 123); another who sees Rom 2 as an example of Paul’s inconsistency in his treatment of the law is H. Räisänen, Paul and the Law [WUNT], 101-9. (6) The list of blessings and curses in Deut 27–30 provide the background for Rom 2; the Gentiles of 2:14 are Gentile Christians, but the condemnation of Jews in 2:17-24 addresses the failure of Jews as a nation to keep the law as a whole (A. Ito, “Romans 2: A Deuteronomistic Reading,” JSNT 59 [1995]: 21-37).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Therefore</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Some interpreters (e.g., C.

Fitzmyer (Romans [AB], 131-35; 305-6) there are at least four different senses: (1) figurative, as a “principle”; (2) generic, meaning “a law”; (3) as a reference to the OT or some part of the OT; and (4) as a reference to the Mosaic law.

Marcus has suggested that the terms used for circumcision (περιτομή, peritomh) and uncircumcision (ἀκροβυστία, akrobustia) were probably derogatory slogans used by Jews and Gentiles to describe their opponents (“The Circumcision and the Uncircumcision in Rome,” NTS 35 [1989]: 77-80).</span></span></span><span class="content"> has its value if you practice the law, but</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This contrast is clearer and stronger in Greek than can be easily expressed in English.</span></span></span><span class="content"> if you break the law,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “if you should be a transgressor of the law.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> your circumcision has become uncircumcision. </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="ROM.2.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content"> Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek word φυλάσσω (fulassw, traditionally translated “keep”) in this context connotes preservation of and devotion to an object as well as obedience.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="ROM.2.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content"> And will not the physically uncircumcised man</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the uncircumcision by nature.” The word “man” is supplied here to make clear that male circumcision (or uncircumcision) is in view.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who keeps the law judge you who, despite</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “through,” but here the preposition seems to mean “(along) with,” “though provided with,” as BDAG 224 s.v. διά A.3.c indicates.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the written code</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “letter.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and circumcision, transgress the law? </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="ROM.2.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content"> For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh, </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="ROM.2.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content"> but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn On circumcision is of the heart see Lev 26:41; Deut 10:16; Jer 4:4; Ezek 44:9.</span></span></span><span class="content"> by the Spirit</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Some have taken the phrase ἐν πνεύματι (en pneumati, “by/in [the] S/spirit”) not as a reference to the Holy Spirit, but referring to circumcision as “spiritual and not literal” (RSV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and not by the written code.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “letter.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> This person’s</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “whose.” The relative pronoun has been replaced by the phrase “this person’s” and, because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> praise is not from people but from God.</span></span></div>
