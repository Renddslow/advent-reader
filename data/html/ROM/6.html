The infinitive is lacking from some mss of the Alexandrian and Western texttypes (Ì46vid A D*,c F G 33vid pc). The infinitive is found elsewhere in the majority of Byzantine mss, suggesting a scribal tendency toward clarification. The lack of infinitive best explains the rise of the other readings. The meaning of the passage is not significantly altered by inclusion or omission, but on internal grounds omission is more likely. NA27 includes the infinitive in brackets, indicating doubt as to its authenticity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> dead to sin, but</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Greek emphasizes the contrast between these two clauses more than can be easily expressed in English.</span></span></span><span class="content"> alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span></span></div>
