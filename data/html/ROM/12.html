See ExSyn 618-19.sn Taken as predicate adjectives, the terms alive, holy, and pleasing are showing how unusual is the sacrifice that believers can now offer, for OT sacrifices were dead. As has often been quipped about this text, “The problem with living sacrifices is that they keep crawling off the altar.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> – which is your reasonable service. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ROM.12.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Do not be conformed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Although συσχηματίζεσθε (suschmatizesqe) could be either a passive or middle, the passive is more likely since it would otherwise have to be a direct middle (“conform yourselves”) and, as such, would be quite rare for NT Greek. It is very telling that being “conformed” to the present world is viewed as a passive notion, for it may suggest that it happens, in part, subconsciously. At the same time, the passive could well be a “permissive passive,” suggesting that there may be some consciousness of the conformity taking place. Most likely, it is a combination of both.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to this present world,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to this age.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may test and approve</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The verb translated test and approve (δοκιμάζω, dokimazw) carries the sense of “test with a positive outcome,” “test so as to approve.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> what is the will of God – what is good and well-pleasing and perfect.</span></span></div>
