These three chapters are among the most difficult and disputed in Paul’s Letter to the Romans. One area of difficulty is the relationship between Israel and the church, especially concerning the nature and extent of Israel’s election. Many different models have been constructed to express this relationship. For a representative survey, see M. Barth, The People of God (JSNTSup), 22-27. The literary genre of these three chapters has been frequently identified as a diatribe, a philosophical discussion or conversation evolved by the Cynic and Stoic schools of philosophy as a means of popularizing their ideas (E. Käsemann, Romans, 261 and 267). But other recent scholars have challenged the idea that Rom 9–11 is characterized by diatribe. Scholars like R. Scroggs and E. E. Ellis have instead identified the material in question as midrash. For a summary and discussion of the rabbinic connections, see W. R. Stegner, “Romans 9.6-29 – A Midrash,” JSNT 22 (1984): 37-52.</span></span></span><span class="content"> I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “my conscience bears witness to me.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the Holy Spirit – </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ROM.9.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “my sorrow is great and the anguish in my heart is unceasing.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="ROM.9.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> For I could wish</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “For I would pray.” The implied condition is “if this could save my fellow Jews.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> that I myself were accursed – cut off from Christ – for the sake of my people,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “brothers.” See BDAG 18-19 s.v. ἀδελφός 2.b.</span></span></span><span class="content"> my fellow countrymen,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “my kinsmen according to the flesh.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ROM.9.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> who are Israelites.

BDAG 1024 s.v. notes, “a legal t.t. of ‘adoption’ of children, in our lit., i.e. in Paul, only in a transferred sense of a transcendent filial relationship between God and humans (with the legal aspect, not gender specificity, as major semantic component).” Although some modern translations remove the filial sense completely and render the term merely “adoption” (cf. NAB, ESV), the retention of this component of meaning was accomplished in the present translation by the phrase “as sons.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “cultic service.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the promises. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="ROM.9.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> To them belong the patriarchs,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “of whom are the fathers.” Because of the length and complexity of the Greek sentence, a new sentence was started here in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and from them,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “from whom.” Here the relative pronoun has been replaced by a personal pronoun.</span></span></span><span class="content"> by human descent,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “according to the flesh.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> came the Christ,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “Messiah.” (Both Greek “Christ” and Hebrew and Aramaic “Messiah” mean “one who has been anointed.”)</span></span></span><span class="content"> who is God over all, blessed forever!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever,” or “the Messiah. God who is over all be blessed forever!” or “the Messiah who is over all. God be blessed forever!” The translational difficulty here is not text-critical in nature, but is a problem of punctuation. Since the genre of these opening verses of Romans 9 is a lament, it is probably best to take this as an affirmation of Christ’s deity (as the text renders it). Although the other renderings are possible, to see a note of praise to God at the end of this section seems strangely out of place. But for Paul to bring his lament to a crescendo (that is to say, his kinsmen had rejected God come in the flesh), thereby deepening his anguish, is wholly appropriate. This is also supported grammatically and stylistically: The phrase ὁ ὢν (Jo wn, “the one who is”) is most naturally taken as a phrase which modifies something in the preceding context, and Paul’s doxologies are always closely tied to the preceding context. For a detailed examination of this verse, see B. M. Metzger, “The Punctuation of Rom. 9:5,” Christ and the Spirit in the New Testament, 95-112; and M. J. Harris, Jesus as God, 144-72.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Amen.</span></span></div>

Second, the lexical force of this verb, coupled with the perfect tense, suggests something of a “done deal” (against some commentaries that see these vessels as ready for destruction yet still able to avert disaster).

The addition, in the middle of the sentence, makes the whole verse read as follows: “For he will execute his sentence completely and quickly in righteousness, because the Lord will do it quickly on the earth.” The shorter reading is found largely in Alexandrian mss (Ì46 א* A B 6 1506 1739 1881 pc co), while the longer reading is found principally in Western and Byzantine mss (א2 D F G Ψ 33 Ï lat). The longer reading follows Isa 10:22-23 (LXX) verbatim, while Paul in the previous verse quoted the LXX loosely. This suggests the addition was made by a copyist trying to make sense out of a difficult passage rather than by the author himself. tn There is a wordplay in Greek (in both the LXX and here) on the phrase translated “completely and quickly” (συντελῶν καὶ συντέμνων, suntelwn kai suntemnwn). These participles are translated as adverbs for smoothness; a more literal (and more cumbersome) rendering would be: “The Lord will act by closing the account [or completing the sentence], and by cutting short the time.” The interpretation of this text is notoriously difficult.
