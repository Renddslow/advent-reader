It should be kept in mind that 1 and 2 Samuel were originally a single book, not separate volumes. Whereas in English Bible tradition the books of Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, and Ezra-Nehemiah are each regarded as two separate books, this was not the practice in ancient Hebrew tradition. Early canonical records, for example, counted them as single books respectively. The division into two books goes back to the Greek translation of the OT and was probably initiated because of the cumbersome length of copies due to the Greek practice (unlike that of Hebrew) of writing vowels. The present division into two books can be a little misleading in terms of perceiving the progression of the argument of the book; in some ways it is preferable to treat the books of 1-2 Samuel in a unified fashion.</span></span></span><span class="content"> when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Amalekites were a nomadic people who inhabited Judah and the Transjordan. They are mentioned in Gen 36:15-16 as descendants of Amalek who in turn descended from Esau. In Exod 17:8-16 they are described as having acted in a hostile fashion toward Israel as the Israelites traveled to Canaan from Egypt. In David’s time the Amalekites were viewed as dangerous enemies who raided, looted, and burned Israelite cities (see 1 Sam 30).</span></span></span><span class="content"> he stayed at Ziklag</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Ziklag was a city in the Negev which had been given to David by Achish king of Gath. For more than a year David used it as a base from which he conducted military expeditions (see 1 Sam 27:5-12). According to 1 Sam 30:1-19, Ziklag was destroyed by the Amalekites while Saul fought the Philistines.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for two days. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="2SA.1.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> On the third day a man arrived from the camp of Saul with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Tearing one’s clothing and throwing dirt on one’s head were outward expressions of grief in the ancient Near East, where such demonstrable reactions were a common response to tragic news.</span></span></span><span class="content"> When he approached David, the man</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent (the man mentioned at the beginning of v. 2) has been specified in the translation to avoid confusion as to who fell to the ground.</span></span></span><span class="content"> threw himself to the ground.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he fell to the ground and did obeisance.”</span></span></span></span></div>

K. McCarter (II Samuel [AB], 59) points out, the Polel of the verb מוּת (mut, “to die”) “refers to dispatching or ‘finishing off’ someone already wounded and near death.” Cf. NLT “put me out of my misery.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> I’m very dizzy,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the dizziness has seized me.” On the meaning of the Hebrew noun translated “dizziness,” see P.

Whether the broken construct phrase is due to the fact that the alleged speaker is in a confused state of mind as he is on the verge of dying, or whether the MT has sustained corruption in the transmission process, is not entirely clear. The former seems likely, although P. K. McCarter understands the MT to be the result of conflation of two shorter forms of text (P. K. McCarter, II Samuel [AB], 57, n. 9). Early translators also struggled with the verse, apparently choosing to leave part of the Hebrew text untranslated. For example, the Lucianic recension of the LXX lacks “all,” while other witnesses (namely, one medieval Hebrew ms, codices A and B of the LXX, and the Syriac Peshitta) lack “still.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="2SA.1.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> So I stood over him and put him to death, since I knew that he couldn’t live in such a condition.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “after his falling”; NAB “could not survive his wound”; CEV “was too badly wounded to live much longer.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then I took the crown which was on his head and the</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The MT lacks the definite article, but this is likely due to textual corruption. It is preferable to read the alef (א) of אֶצְעָדָה (’ets’adah) as a ה (he) giving הַצְּעָדָה (hatsÿ’adah). There is no reason to think that the soldier confiscated from Saul’s dead body only one of two or more bracelets that he was wearing (cf. NLT “one of his bracelets”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> bracelet which was on his arm. I have brought them here to my lord.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The claims that the soldier is making here seem to contradict the story of Saul’s death as presented in 1 Sam 31:3-5. In that passage it appears that Saul took his own life, not that he was slain by a passerby who happened on the scene. Some scholars account for the discrepancy by supposing that conflicting accounts have been brought together in the MT. However, it is likely that the young man is here fabricating the account in a self-serving way so as to gain favor with David, or so he supposes. He probably had come across Saul’s corpse, stolen the crown and bracelet from the body, and now hopes to curry favor with David by handing over to him these emblems of Saul’s royalty. But in so doing the Amalekite greatly miscalculated David’s response to this alleged participation in Saul’s death. The consequence of his lies will instead be his own death.</span></span></span></span></div>

Some interpreters (e.g., S. R. Driver, P. K. McCarter, Jr.) suggest deleting the word from the text (cf. NAB, TEV), but there does not seem to be sufficient evidence for doing so. Others (cf. KJV) understand the reference to be elliptical, meaning “the use of the bow.” The verse would then imply that with the deaths of Saul and Jonathan having occurred, a period of trying warfare is about to begin, requiring adequate preparation for war on the part of the younger generation. Various other views may also be found in the secondary literature. However, it seems best to understand the word here to be a reference to the name of a song (i.e., “The Bow”), most likely the poem that follows in vv. 19-27 (cf. ASV, NASB, NRSV, CEV, NLT); NIV “this lament of the bow.” To make this clear the words “the song of” are supplied in the translation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Indeed, it is written down in the Book of Yashar.)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Book of Yashar is a noncanonical writing no longer in existence.

Although the Syriac Peshitta understands the statement to pertain to Saul, the point here is not that Saul is not anointed. Rather, it is the shield of Saul that lies discarded and is no longer anointed. In ancient Near Eastern practice a warrior’s shield that was in normal use would have to be anointed regularly in order to ensure that the leather did not become dry and brittle. Like other warriors of his day Saul would have carefully maintained his tools of trade. But now that he is dead, the once-cared-for shield of the mighty warrior lies sadly discarded and woefully neglected, a silent but eloquent commentary on how different things are now compared to the way they were during Saul’s lifetime.</span></span></span></span></div>
