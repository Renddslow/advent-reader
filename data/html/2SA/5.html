The Kethib is the Qal perfect 3cp שָׂנְאוּ (sanÿ’u, “they hated”), referring to the Jebusites’ attitude toward David. The Qere is the Qal passive participle construct plural שְׂנֻאֵי (sÿnu’e, “hated”), referring to David’s attitude toward the Jebusites. 4QSama has the Qal perfect 3rd person feminine singular שָׂנְאָה (sanÿ’ah, “hated”), the subject of which would be “the soul of David.” The difference is minor and the translation adopted above works for either the Kethib or the Qere.</span></span></span><span class="content"> by going through the water tunnel.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The meaning of the Hebrew term has been debated.

It would have provided a means for surprise attack against the occupants of the city of David. The LXX seems not to understand the reference here, translating “by the water shaft” as “with a small knife.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> For this reason it is said, “The blind and the lame cannot enter the palace.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the house.” TEV takes this as a reference to the temple (“the Lord’s house”).</span></span></span></span></div>
