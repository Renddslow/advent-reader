It is a literary unit that describes David’s efforts at consolidating his own kingdom following the demise of King Saul; it also provides the transition to subsequent leadership on the part of David’s successor Solomon.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then David asked, “Is anyone still left from the family</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “house.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Saul, so that I may extend kindness to him for the sake of Jonathan?”</span></span></div>

The ancient versions are not unanimous in the way that they render the phrase. The LXX has “the table of David” (τῆς τραπέζης Δαυιδ, th&quot; trapezh&quot; Dauid); the Syriac Peshitta has “the table of the king” (patureh demalka’); the Vulgate has “your table” (mensam tuam). The present translation follows the LXX.</span></span></span><span class="content"> just as though he were one of the king’s sons.</span></span></div>
