The root therefore is אסף (’sf, “to gather”). The Masoretes, however, pointed the verb as וַיֹּסֶף (vayyosef), understanding it to be a form of יָסַף (yasaf, “to add”). This does not fit the context, which calls for a verb of gathering.</span></span></span><span class="content"> all the best</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “chosen.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> men in Israel, thirty thousand in number. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="2SA.6.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> David and all the men who were with him traveled</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “arose and went.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “from,” but the following context indicates they traveled to this location.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Baalah</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This is another name for Kiriath-jearim (see 1 Chr 13:6).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God which is called by the name</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The MT has here a double reference to the name (שֵׁם שֵׁם, shem shem).
