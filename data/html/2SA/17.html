Modern translations are divided as well: the NAB, NRSV, REB, and NLT follow the LXX, while the NASB and NIV follow the Hebrew text.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The entire army will return unharmed.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “all of the people will be safe.”</span></span></span></span></div>
