Internally, it is possible that the second person pronoun arose through scribal conformity to the second person pronoun used previously in v. 3 (i.e., ὑμῶν) and following in v. 4 (ὑμεῖς, Jumeis). But in terms of external criteria, the second person pronoun has superior ms support (though there is an Alexandrian split) and ἡμῶν may have arisen through accident (error of sight) or scribal attempt to universalize the statement since all Christians have Jesus as their life.

The words are omitted by several English translations (NASB, NIV, ESV, TNIV). This textual problem is quite difficult to resolve. On the one hand, the parallel account in Eph 5:6 has these words, thus providing scribes a motive for adding them here. On the other hand, the reading without the words may be too hard: The ἐν οἷς (en |oi&quot;) of v. 7 seems to have no antecedent without υἱούς already in the text, although it could possibly be construed as neuter referring to the vice list in v. 5. Further, although the witness of B is especially important, there are other places in which B and Ì46 share errant readings of omission. Nevertheless, the strength of the internal evidence against the longer reading is at least sufficient to cause doubt here. The decision to retain the words in the text is less than certain. sn The expression sons of disobedience is a Semitic idiom that means “people characterized by disobedience.” In this context it refers to “all those who are disobedient.” Cf. Eph 5:6.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="COL.3.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> You also lived your lives</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “you also walked.” The verb περιπατέω (peripatew) is commonly used in the NT to refer to behavior or conduct of one’s life (L&amp;N 41.11).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in this way at one time, when you used to live among them. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="COL.3.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> But now, put off all such things</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek article with τὰ πάντα (ta panta) is anaphoric, referring to the previous list of vices, and has been translated here as “all such things.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> as anger, rage, malice, slander, abusive language from your mouth. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="COL.3.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with its practices </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="COL.3.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> and have been clothed with the new man</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Put off all such things. The commands in vv. 8-9 are based on two reasons given in vv. 9-10 – reasons which are expressed in terms of a metaphor about clothing oneself. Paul says that they have put off the old man and have put on the new man. Two things need to be discussed in reference to Paul’s statement. (1) What is the meaning of the clothing imagery (i.e., the “have put off” and “have been clothed”)? (2) What is the meaning of the old man and the new man? Though some commentators understand the participles “have put off” (v. 9) and “have been clothed” (v. 10) as imperatives (i.e., “put off!” and “put on!”), this use of participles is extremely rare in the NT and thus unlikely here. It is better to take them as having the semantic force of indicatives, and thus they give an explanation of what had happened to the Colossians at the time of their conversion – they had taken off the old man and put on the new when they trusted in Christ (cf. 1:4). While it is difficult to say for certain what the background to Paul’s “clothing” metaphor might be (whether it is primarily Jewish and comes from the OT, or primarily Gentile and comes from some facet of the Greco-Roman religious milieu), it is nonetheless clear, on the basis of Paul’s usage of the expression, that the old man refers to man as he is in Adam and dominated by sin (cf. Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22), while the new man refers to the Christian whose new sphere of existence is in Christ. Though the metaphor of clothing oneself primarily reflects outward actions, there is a distinct inward aspect to it, as the rest of v. 10 indicates: being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it. Paul’s point, then, is that Christians should take off their dirty clothing (inappropriate behavior) and put on clean clothing (behavior consistent with knowing Christ) because this has already been accomplished in a positional sense at the time of their conversion (cf. Gal 3:27 with Rom 13:14).</span></span></span><span class="content"> that is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one who created it. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="COL.3.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> Here there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on “fellow slave” in 1:7.</span></span></span><span class="content"> or free, but Christ is all and in all.</span></span></div>

(2) With the imperative, one might expect ὡς τῷ κυρίῳ (Jw&quot; tw kuriw), as for example in Eph 6:7. In favor of the imperative: (1) an imperative resumes the ἐργάζεσθε (ergazesqe) in v. 23a and forms a chiasm with it; (2) an imperative makes more sense of the γάρ (gar) in v. 25a; (3) an imperative relates equally well to the preceding statement; (4) a parallel can be found in Rom 12:11 which uses an imperatival participle δουλεύοντες (douleuonte&quot;) with the dative τῷ κυρίῳ.
