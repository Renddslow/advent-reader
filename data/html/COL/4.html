The reference to the idea that Paul must make it known indicates that this clause is probably best viewed as purpose and not content, like the ἵνα of v. 3. It is the second purpose stated in the context; the first is expressed through the infinitive λαλῆσαι (lalhsai) in v. 3. The term “pray” at the beginning of the sentence is intended to pick up the imperative of v. 3.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="COL.4.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Conduct yourselves</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “walk.” The verb περιπατέω (peripatew) is a common NT idiom for one’s lifestyle, behavior, or manner of conduct (L&amp;N 41.11).</span></span></span><span class="content"> with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunities. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="COL.4.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer everyone. </span></span></div>

In terms of Jewish converts,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “those of the circumcision.” The verse as a whole is difficult to translate because it is unclear whether Paul is saying (1) that the only people working with him are Jewish converts at the time the letter is being written or previously, or (2) that Aristarchus, Mark, and Jesus Justus were the only Jewish Christians who ever worked with him. Verses 12-14 appear to indicate that Luke and Demas, who were Gentiles, were also working currently with Paul. This is the view adopted in the translation. See M. J. Harris, Colossians and Philemon (EGGNT), 207-8.</span></span></span><span class="content"> these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="COL.4.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Epaphras, who is one of you and a slave</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on “fellow slave” in 1:7.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Christ,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc ‡ Strong Alexandrian testimony, along with some other witnesses, suggests that ᾿Ιησοῦ (Ihsou, “Jesus”) follows Χριστοῦ (Cristou, “Christ”; so א A B C I L 0278 33 81 365 629 1175 2464 al lat), but the evidence for the shorter reading is diverse (Ì46 D F G Ψ 075 1739 1881 Ï it sy Hier), cutting across all major texttypes. There can be little motivation for omitting the name of Jesus; hence, the shorter reading is judged to be original.

Scribes that considered Nympha to be a man’s name had the corresponding masculine pronoun αὐτοῦ here (autou, “his”; so D [F G] Ψ Ï), while those who saw Nympha as a woman read the feminine αὐτῆς here (auth&quot;, “her”; B 0278 6 1739[*] 1881 sa). Several mss (א A C P 075 33 81 104 326 1175 2464 bo) have αὐτῶν (autwn, “their”), perhaps because of indecisiveness on the gender of Nympha, perhaps because they included ἀδελφούς (adelfou&quot;, here translated “brothers and sisters”) as part of the referent. (Perhaps because accents were not part of the original text, scribes were particularly confused here.) The harder reading is certainly αὐτῆς, and thus Nympha should be considered a woman.</span></span></span><span class="content"> house.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the church in her house.” The meaning is that Paul sends greetings to the church that meets at Nympha’s house.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="COL.4.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> And after</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “when.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> you have read this letter, have it read</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The construction beginning with the imperative ποιήσατε ἵνα…ἀναγνωσθῇ (poihsate Jina…anagnwsqh) should be translated as “have it read” where the conjunction ἵνα functions to mark off its clause as the direct object of the imperative ποιήσατε. The content of the clause (“reading the letter”) is what Paul commands with the imperative ποιήσατε.

Such a conclusion is routinely added by scribes to NT books because a few of these books originally had such an ending (cf. Rom 16:27; Gal 6:18; Jude 25). A majority of Greek witnesses have the concluding ἀμήν in every NT book except Acts, James, and 3 John (and even in these books, ἀμήν is found in some witnesses). It is thus a predictable variant. Further, the external evidence for the omission is quite compelling (א* A B C F G 048 6 33 81 1739* 1881 sa). The strongly preferred reading is therefore the omission of ἀμήν.</span></span></span></span></div>
