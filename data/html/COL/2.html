Scribes would be prone to conform this to more common Pauline expressions such as “of God, who is in Christ” (33), “of God, the Father of Christ” (א* A C 048vid 1175 bo), and “of the God and Father of Christ” (א2 Ψ 075 0278 365 1505 pc). Even though the external support for the wording τοῦ θεοῦ, Χριστοῦ is hardly overwhelming, it clearly best explains the rise of the other readings and should thus be regarded as authentic.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="COL.2.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="COL.2.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> I say this so that no one will deceive you through arguments</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn BDAG 812 s.v. πιθανολογία states, “persuasive speech, art of persuasion (so Pla., Theaet. 162e) in an unfavorable sense in its only occurrence in our lit. ἐν πιθανολογίᾳ by specious arguments Col 2:4 (cp.

Both τὸν Χριστὸν ᾿Ιησοῦν (ton Criston Ihsoun) and τὸν κύριον (ton kurion) are equally definite insofar as they both have an article, but both the word order and the use of “Christ Jesus” as a proper name suggest that it is the object (cf. Rom 10:9, 10). Thus Paul is affirming that the tradition that was delivered to the Colossians by Epaphras was Christ-centered and focused on him as Lord.</span></span></span><span class="content"> continue to live your lives</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The present imperative περιπατεῖτε (peripateite) implies, in this context, a continuation of something already begun. This is evidenced by the fact that Paul has already referred to their faith as “orderly” and “firm” (2:5), despite the struggles of some of them with this deceptive heresy (cf. 2:16-23). The verb is used literally to refer to a person “walking” and is thus used metaphorically (i.e., ethically) to refer to the way a person lives his or her life.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in him, </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="COL.2.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> rooted</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “having been rooted.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and built up in him and firm</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The three participles rooted, built up, and firm belong together and reflect three different metaphors. The first participle “rooted” (perfect tense) indicates a settled condition on the part of the Colossian believers and refers to horticulture. The second participle “built up” (present passive) comes from the world of architecture. The third participle “firm [established]” (present passive) comes from the law courts. With these three metaphors (as well as the following comment on thankfulness) Paul explains what he means when he commands them to continue to live their lives in Christ. The use of the passive probably reflects God’s activity among them. It was he who had rooted them, had been building them up, and had established them in the faith (cf. 1 Cor 3:5-15 for the use of mixed metaphors).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in your</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek text has the article τῇ (th), not the possessive pronoun ὑμῶν (Jumwn), but the article often functions as a possessive pronoun and was translated as such here (ExSyn 215).</span></span></span><span class="content"> faith just as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="COL.2.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek construction here is somewhat difficult and can be literally rendered “Be careful, lest someone shall be the one who takes you captive.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> through an empty, deceitful philosophy</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek reads τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης (th&quot; filosofia&quot; kai kenh&quot; apath&quot;). The two nouns φιλοσοφίας and κενῆς are joined by one article and probably form a hendiadys. Thus the second noun was taken as modifying the first, as the translation shows.</span></span></span><span class="content"> that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase κατὰ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου (kata ta stoiceia tou kosmou) is difficult to translate because of problems surrounding the precise meaning of στοιχεῖα in this context. Originally it referred to the letters of the alphabet, with the idea at its root of “things in a row”; see C. Vaughn, “Colossians,” EBC 11:198. M. J. Harris (Colossians and Philemon [EGGNT], 93) outlines three probable options: (1) the material elements which comprise the physical world; (2) the elementary teachings of the world (so NEB, NASB, NIV); (3) the elemental spirits of the world (so NEB, RSV). The first option is highly unlikely because Paul is not concerned here with the physical elements, e.g., carbon or nitrogen. The last two options are both possible. Though the Gnostic-like heresy at Colossae would undoubtedly have been regarded by Paul as an “elementary teaching” at best, because the idea of “spirits” played such a role in Gnostic thought, he may very well have had in mind elemental spirits that operated in the world or controlled the world (i.e., under God’s authority and permission).</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the world, and not according to Christ. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="COL.2.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> For in him all the fullness of deity lives</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn In him all the fullness of deity lives. The present tense in this verse (“lives”) is significant. Again, as was stated in the note on 1:19, this is not a temporary dwelling, but a permanent one. Paul’s point is polemical against the idea that the fullness of God dwells anywhere else, as the Gnostics believed, except in Christ alone. At the incarnation, the second person of the Trinity assumed humanity, and is forever the God-man.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in bodily form, </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="COL.2.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> and you have been filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="COL.2.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> In him you also were circumcised – not, however,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The terms “however” and “but” in this sentence were supplied in order to emphasize the contrast.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with a circumcision performed by human hands, but by the removal</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The articular noun τῇ ἀπεκδύσει (th apekdusei) is a noun which ends in -σις (-sis) and therefore denotes action, i.e., “removal.” Since the head noun is a verbal noun, the following genitive τοῦ σώματος (tou swmatos) is understood as an objective genitive, receiving the action of the head noun.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the fleshly body,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “in the removal of the body of flesh.” The genitive τῆς σαρκός (th&quot; sarko&quot;) has been translated as an attributive genitive, “fleshly body.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> that is,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The second prepositional phrase beginning with ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ (en th peritomh) is parallel to the prepositional phrase ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει (en th apekdusei) and gives a further explanation of it.

Thus the best solution is to see αὐτῷ as a reference to the cross and the preposition ἐν (en) indicating “means” (i.e., by means of the cross) or possibly (though less likely) location (on the cross).</span></span></span></span></div>

The καί looks to be a motivated reading in that it makes ἀφειδία (afeidia) “the third in a series of datives after ἐν, rather than an instrumental dative qualifying the previous prepositional phrase” (TCGNT 556). At the same time, the omission of καί could possibly have been unintentional. A decision is difficult, but the shorter reading is slightly preferred.

The Greek particle μέν (men) is the second word of the embedded subordinate clause.

The translation has placed the subordinate clause first in order for clarity instead of retaining its embedded location. For a detailed discussion of this grammatical construction, see B.
