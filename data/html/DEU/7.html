The center of Hittite power was in Anatolia (central modern Turkey). In the Late Bronze Age (1550-1200 b.c.) they were at their zenith, establishing outposts and colonies near and far. Some elements were obviously in Canaan at the time of the Conquest (1400-1350 b.c.).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Girgashites,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Girgashites.

This is an ideal number in the OT, one symbolizing fullness or completeness. Therefore, the intent of the text here is not to be precise and list all of Israel’s enemies but simply to state that Israel will have a full complement of foes to deal with. For other lists of Canaanites, some with fewer than seven peoples, see Exod 3:8; 13:5; 23:23, 28; 33:2; 34:11; Deut 20:17; Josh 3:10; 9:1; 24:11. Moreover, the “Table of Nations” (Gen 10:15-19) suggests that all of these (possibly excepting the Perizzites) were offspring of Canaan and therefore Canaanites.</span></span></span><span class="content"> nations more numerous and powerful than you – </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="DEU.7.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> and he</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord your God.” The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</span></span></span><span class="content"> delivers them over to you and you attack them, you must utterly annihilate</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn In the Hebrew text the infinitive absolute before the finite verb emphasizes the statement.

The Hebrew word (מַצֵּבֹת, matsevot) denotes a standing pillar, usually made of stone. Its purpose was to mark the presence of a shrine or altar thought to have been visited by deity. Though sometimes associated with pure worship of the Lord (Gen 28:18, 22; 31:13; 35:14; Exod 24:4), these pillars were usually associated with pagan cults and rituals (Exod 23:24; 34:13; Deut 12:3; 1 Kgs 14:23; 2 Kgs 17:10; Hos 3:4; 10:1; Jer 43:13).</span></span></span><span class="content"> cut down their sacred Asherah poles,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Sacred Asherah poles.

She was commonly worshiped at shrines in or near groves of evergreen trees, or, failing that, at places marked by wooden poles (Hebrew אֲשֵׁרִים [’asherim], as here). They were to be burned or cut down (Deut 12:3; 16:21; Judg 6:25, 28, 30; 2 Kgs 18:4).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and burn up their idols. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="DEU.7.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> For you are a people holy</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn That is, “set apart.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God.

The Hebrew verb translated “redeeming” (from the root פָּדָה, padah) has the idea of redemption by the payment of a ransom. The initial symbol of this was the Passover lamb, offered by Israel to the Lord as ransom in exchange for deliverance from bondage and death (Exod 12:1-14). Later, the firstborn sons of Israel, represented by the Levites, became the ransom (Num 3:11-13). These were all types of the redemption effected by the death of Christ who described his atoning work as “a ransom for many” (Matt 20:28; cf. 1 Pet 1:18).</span></span></span><span class="content"> you from the place of slavery, from the power</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “hand” (so KJV, NRSV), a metaphor for power or domination.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Pharaoh king of Egypt. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="DEU.7.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> So realize that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God is the true God,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the God.” The article here expresses uniqueness; cf.
