This is the only reference to this practice in an OT legal text but it is illustrated in the story of Judah and his sons (Gen 38) and possibly in the account of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 2:8; 3:12; 4:6).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="DEU.25.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Then</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and it will be that.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the first son</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the firstborn.” This refers to the oldest male child.</span></span></span><span class="content"> she bears will continue the name of the dead brother, thus preventing his name from being blotted out of Israel. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="DEU.25.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s widow, then she</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “want to take his sister-in-law, then his sister in law.” In the second instance the pronoun (“she”) has been used in the translation to avoid redundancy.</span></span></span><span class="content"> must go to the elders at the town gate and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s name in Israel; he is unwilling to perform the duty of a brother-in-law to me!” </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="DEU.25.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Then the elders of his city must summon him and speak to him.
