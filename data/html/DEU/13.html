The difference between a prophet (נָבִיא, navi’) and one who foretells by dreams (חֹלֵם אוֹ, ’o kholem) was not so much one of office – for both received revelation by dreams (cf. Num 12:6) – as it was of function or emphasis. The prophet was more a proclaimer and interpreter of revelation whereas the one who foretold by dreams was a receiver of revelation. In later times the role of the one who foretold by dreams was abused and thus denigrated as compared to that of the prophet (cf. Jer 23:28).</span></span></span><span class="content"> should appear among you and show you a sign or wonder,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The expression אוֹת אוֹ מוֹפֵת (’ot ’o mofet) became a formulaic way of speaking of ways of authenticating prophetic messages or other works of God (cf.

They could, however, be counterfeited or (as here) permitted to false prophets by the Lord as a means of testing his people.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="DEU.13.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> and the sign or wonder should come to pass concerning what he said to you, namely, “Let us follow other gods” – gods whom you have not previously known – “and let us serve them.” </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="DEU.13.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> You must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “or dreamer of dreams.” See note on this expression in v. 1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God will be testing you to see if you love him</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord your God.” The pronoun has been used in the translation for stylistic reasons to avoid redundancy.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with all your mind and being.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “all your heart and soul” (so NRSV, CEV, NLT); or “heart and being” (NCV “your whole being”).
