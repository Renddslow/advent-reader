This would seem to contradict Exod 12:9 where the Israelites are told not to eat the Passover sacrifice raw or boiled. However, 2 Chr 35:13 recounts the celebration of a Passover feast during the reign of Josiah, and explains that the people “cooked (בָּשַׁל, bashal) the Passover sacrifices over the open fire.” The use of בָּשַׁל (bashal) with “fire” (אֵשׁ, ’esh) suggests that the word could be used to speak of boiling or roasting.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and eat it in the place the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God chooses; you may return the next morning to your tents. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="DEU.16.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> You must eat bread made without yeast for six days.

The rendering “booths” (cf. NAB, NASB, NRSV) is now preferable to the traditional “tabernacles” (KJV, ASV, NIV) in light of the meaning of the term סֻכָּה (sukkah, “hut; booth”), but “booths” are frequently associated with trade shows and craft fairs in contemporary American English. Clearer is the English term “shelters” (so NCV, TEV, CEV, NLT), but this does not reflect the temporary nature of the living arrangement. This feast was a commemoration of the wanderings of the Israelites after they left Egypt, suggesting that a translation like “temporary shelters” is more appropriate.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for seven days, at the time of the grain and grape harvest.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “when you gather in your threshing-floor and winepress.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="DEU.16.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> You are to rejoice in your festival, you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites, the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows who are in your villages.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in your gates.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="DEU.16.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> You are to celebrate the festival seven days before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God in the place he</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord.” See note on “he” in 16:1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> chooses, for he</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord your God.” See note on “he” in 16:1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will bless you in all your productivity and in whatever you do;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in all the work of your hands” (so NASB, NIV); NAB, NRSV “in all your undertakings.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> so you will indeed rejoice! </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="DEU.16.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> Three times a year all your males must appear before the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God in the place he chooses for the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Temporary Shelters; and they must not appear before him</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord.” See note on “he” in 16:1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> empty-handed. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="DEU.16.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> Every one of you must give as you are able,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a man must give according to the gift of his hand.” This has been translated as second person for stylistic reasons, in keeping with the second half of the verse, which is second person rather than third.</span></span></span><span class="content"> according to the blessing of the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> your God that he has given you.</span></span></div>
