Mourners often wore mourning clothes and refrained from washing or using cosmetics (Gen 38:14, 19; 2 Sam 12:20; 14:2), so Ruth’s attire and appearance would signal that her period of mourning was over and she was now available for remarriage (see Bush, 152).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then go down</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The consonantal text (Kethib) has וְיָרַדְתִּי (vÿyaradtiy, “then I will go down”; Qal perfect 1st person common singular), while the marginal reading (Qere) is וְיָרַדְתְּ (vÿyaradt, “then you go down”; Qal perfect 2nd person feminine singular) which makes more much sense in context.

In Ruth 2, where Ruth has just arrived from Moab and is very much aware of her position as a foreigner (v. 10), she acknowledges Boaz’s kindness and emphasizes her own humility by using the term שִׁפְחָה, though she admits that she does not even occupy that lowly position on the social scale. However, here in chap. 3, where Naomi sends her to Boaz to seek marriage, she uses the more elevated term אָמָה to describe herself because she is now aware of Boaz’s responsibility as a close relative of her deceased husband and she wants to challenge him to fulfill his obligation. In her new social context she is dependent on Boaz (hence the use of אָמָה), but she is no mere שִׁפְחָה.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Marry your servant,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and spread your wing [or skirt] over your servant.” Many medieval Hebrew mss have the plural/dual “your wings” rather than the singular “your wing, skirt.” The latter is more likely here in the context of Ruth’s marriage proposal. In the metaphorical account in Ezek 16:8, God spreads his skirt over naked Jerusalem as an act of protection and as a precursor to marriage. Thus Ruth’s words can be taken, in effect, as a marriage proposal (and are so translated here; cf. TEV “So please marry me”). See F. W. Bush, Ruth, Esther (WBC), 164-65.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for you are a guardian of the family interests.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “for you are a גֹאֵל [go’el],” sometimes translated “redeemer” (cf. NIV “a kinsman-redeemer”; NLT “my family redeemer”). In this context Boaz, as a “redeemer,” functions as a guardian of the family interests who has responsibility for caring for the widows of his deceased kinsmen. For a discussion of the legal background, see F. W. Bush, Ruth, Esther (WBC), 166-69.sn By proposing marriage, Ruth goes beyond the letter of Naomi’s instructions (see v. 4, where Naomi told Ruth that Boaz would tell her what to do). Though she is more aggressive than Naomi told her to be, she is still carrying out the intent of Naomi’s instructions, which were designed to lead to marriage.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="RUT.3.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> He said, “May you be rewarded</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “blessed” (so NASB, NRSV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> by the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, my dear!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my daughter.” This form of address is a mild form of endearment, perhaps merely rhetorical.

Ruth’s former act of devotion was her decision to remain and help Naomi. The latter act of devotion is her decision to marry Boaz to provide a child to carry on her deceased husband’s (and Elimelech’s) line and to provide for Naomi in her old age (see Ruth 4:5, 10, 15).</span></span></span><span class="content"> For you have not sought to marry</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “by not going after the young men” (NASB similar); TEV “You might have gone looking for a young man.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> one of the young men, whether rich or poor.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “whether poor or rich” (so KJV, NAB, NASB, NRSV); the more common English idiom reverses the order (“rich or poor”; cf.

However, only by marrying a גֹּאֵל (go’el, “family guardian”; traditionally “redeemer”) could she carry on her dead husband’s line and make provision for Naomi.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="RUT.3.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> Now, my dear, don’t worry!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “do not fear” (so NASB); NRSV “do not be afraid.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> I intend to do for you everything you propose,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “everything which you are saying I will do for you.” The Hebrew word order emphasizes Boaz’s intention to fulfill Ruth’s request. As in v. 5, the Hebrew imperfect is used (note “you are saying”), even though Ruth’s request appears to be concluded. According to GKC 316 §107.h, the imperfect can sometimes “express actions, etc., which although, strictly speaking, they are already finished, are regarded as still lasting on into the present time, or continuing to operate in it.” The imperfect אֶעֱשֶׂה (’e’eseh) could be translated “I will do” (so NAB, NIV, NRSV, NLT), but since there are legal complications which must first be resolved, it is better to take the form as indicating Boaz’s desire or intention, if the legal matters can be worked out.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for everyone in the village</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “all the gate of the town,” which by metonymy could refer to everyone in town (NIV “All my fellow townsmen”; NLT “everyone in town”), or only to the leaders and prominent citizens of the community (Boaz’s peers) who transacted business and made legal decisions at the town gate (NRSV “all the assembly of my people”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> knows that you are a worthy woman.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “woman of strong character” (cf.

Six omers (an omer being a tenth of an ephah) seems too little, since this would have amounted to six-tenths of an ephah, less than Ruth had gleaned in a single day (cf. 2:17). Thus a seah (one third of an ephah) may be in view here; six seahs would amount to two ephahs, about 60 pounds (27 kg). See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., Ruth (NICOT), 222, and F. W.
