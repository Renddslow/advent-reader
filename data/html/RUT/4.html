Certainly Boaz would have known his relative’s name, especially in such a small village, and would have uttered his actual name. However the narrator refuses to record his name in a form of poetic justice because he refused to preserve Mahlon’s “name” (lineage) by marrying his widow (see 4:5, 9-10). This close relative, who is a literary foil for Boaz, refuses to fulfill the role of family guardian. Because he does nothing memorable, he remains anonymous in a chapter otherwise filled with names. His anonymity contrasts sharply with Boaz’s prominence in the story and the fame he attains through the child born to Ruth. Because the actual name of this relative is not recorded, the translation of this expression is difficult since contemporary English style expects either a name or title. This is usually supplied in modern translations: “friend” (NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV, NLT), “so-and-so” (JPS, NJPS). Perhaps “Mr. So-And-So!” or “Mr. No-Name!” makes the point. For discussion see Adele Berlin, Poetics and Interpretation of Biblical Narrative, 99-101; R. L. Hubbard, Jr., Ruth (NICOT), 233-35; F. W. Bush, Ruth, Esther (WBC), 196-97. In the present translation “John Doe” is used since it is a standard designation for someone who is a party to legal proceedings whose true name is unknown.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So he came</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he turned aside” (so KJV, NASB); NRSV “And he went over.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and sat down. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="RUT.4.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Boaz chose ten of the village leaders</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he took ten men from the elders of the town.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and said, “Sit down here!” So they sat down. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="RUT.4.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Then Boaz said to the guardian,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “redeemer.” See the note on the phrase “guardian of the family interests” in 3:9.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Naomi, who has returned from the region of Moab, is selling</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The perfect form of the verb here describes as a simple fact an action that is underway (cf.

Naomi may have been selling the property rights to the land, but this seems unlikely in light of what is known about ancient Israelite property laws. It is more likely that Naomi, being a woman, held only the right to use the land until the time of her remarriage or death (F. W. Bush, Ruth, Esther [WBC], 202-4). Because she held this right to use of the land, she also had the right to buy it back from the its current owner. (This assumes that Elimelech sold the land prior to going to Moab.) Since she did not possess the means to do so, however, she decided to dispose of her rights in the matter. She was not selling the land per se, but disposing of the right to its redemption and use, probably in exchange for room and board with the purchaser (Bush, 211-15). If this is correct, it might be preferable to translate, “Naomi is disposing of her rights to the portion of land,” although such a translation presumes some knowledge of ancient Israelite property laws.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the portion of land that belongs to our relative Elimelech. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="RUT.4.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> So I am legally informing you:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and I said [or perhaps, “thought to myself”], ‘I will [or “must”] uncover your ear, saying’”; NAB “So I thought I would inform you”; NIV “I thought I should bring the matter to your attention.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Acquire it before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “before those sitting here and before the leaders of my people” appears to refer to the leaders who were specially chosen as witnesses (v. 2) and the larger group of community leaders standing by.

W. Bush, Ruth, Esther [WBC], 202). However, the BHS editors suggest reading גם את־ (“as well as…”; emphatic particle גם [“also”] and the definite direct object marker אֵת) introducing the second part of the acquisition: He would be acquiring the field and Ruth. This alternate reading is reflected in the Vulgate reading quoque (“and also”) and supported by parallel usage in v. 9, “I am acquiring the field from Naomi, and also (גָּם אֵת־, gam ’et) Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> acquire Ruth the Moabite,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The MT (Kethib) reads קָנִיתִי (qaniti, “I acquire,” Qal perfect 1st person common singular): “When you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, I acquire Ruth the Moabitess…” However, the marginal reading (Qere) is קָנִיתָה (qanitah, “you acquire,” Qal perfect 2nd person masculine singular, reflected in 2nd person masculine singular forms in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and Syriac): “When you acquire the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess…” The Qere is probably original because the Kethib is too difficult syntactically and contextually, while the Qere makes perfect sense: (1) Boaz stated in 3:13 that the nearest kinsman had the first right to acquire Ruth if he wanted to do so, and only the Qere reading here presents him with that option; and (2) Boaz announces in 4:9-10 that he was acquiring the field and Ruth as a package deal in 4:9-10, and only the Qere reading here presents the nearest kinsman with the same package deal. The Kethib probably arose by a scribe trying to harmonize 4:5 with the 1st person common singular form in 4:9-10 without fully understanding the ploy of Boaz in 4:5. See F. W. Bush, Ruth, Esther (WBC), 216-17.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the wife of our deceased relative,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The presence of two difficult textual problems in this line (see two preceding notes) has produced a combination of four different ways in which this line can be rendered: (1) “When you acquire the field from Naomi, you must acquire [it] from Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased” (KJV, NKJV); (2) “When you acquire the field from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, you must acquire the wife of the deceased” (JPS, NJPS, NIV); (3) “When you acquire the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased” (NASB, NCV, TEV, RSV, NRSV, NLT); and (4) “When you acquire the field from Naomi, then I acquire Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased” (REB). The third option is adopted here. sn Our deceased relative.

It is not entirely clear how acquiring Ruth and raising up an heir for the deceased Elimelech would ruin this individual’s inheritance. Perhaps this means that the inheritance of his other children would be diminished. See R. L. Hubbard, Jr., Ruth (NICOT), 245-46.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in that case. You may exercise my redemption option, for I am unable to redeem it.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “redeem for yourself, you, my right of redemption for I am unable to redeem.”sn Here it appears that the acquisition of Ruth along with the land was an obligatory package deal (“When you acquire the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth…”). On the other hand, Boaz viewed marriage to Ruth as voluntary in 3:13 (“If he does not want to redeem you, I will redeem you”), and presented the acquisition of the field as voluntary in 4:4 (“If you want to exercise your right…but if not, tell me!”). Initially, Boaz makes the transaction appear to be a mere land deal in 4:4. When the nearest relative jumped at the land offer, Boaz confronted him with the attendant social/family obligation of marrying Ruth to raise up an heir for the deceased to inherit this very land. By conducting the transaction in public where the close relative would need to save face, Boaz forced him either to reject the offer entirely or to include Ruth in the deal – but he could not take the land and reject Ruth. Either way, Ruth would be cared for and Elimelech’s line continued. But if he took Ruth, the acquisition of the land would be more economically burdensome than beneficial, so he yielded his purchase option to Boaz. For discussion, see F. W. Bush, Ruth, Esther (WBC), 229-33.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="RUT.4.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> (Now this used to be the customary way to finalize a transaction involving redemption in Israel:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and this formerly in Israel concerning redemption and concerning a transfer to ratify every matter.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> A man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a man removed his sandal and gave [it] to his companion”; NASB “gave it to another”; NIV, NRSV, CEV “to the other.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> This was a legally binding act</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the legal witness”; KJV “a testimony”; ASV, NASB “the manner (form NAB) of attestation.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in Israel.) </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="RUT.4.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> So the guardian said to Boaz, “You may acquire it,” and he removed his sandal.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The LXX adds “and gave it to him” (cf.

The omission of the suffix with “name” could be explained as virtual haplography (note the letter bet [ב], which is similar to kaf [כ], at the beginning of the next word). The same explanation could account for the omission of the prefixed yod (י) on the verb “call” (yod [י] and vav [ו] are similar in appearance).
