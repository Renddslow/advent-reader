The occupation of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus’ point may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite of minimal results), the infinite value of the new “catch” (viz., people), and perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane, Mark [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the opposite of catching fish: The fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten; people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give them new life.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="MAT.4.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content"> They</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here δέ (de) has not been translated.</span></span></span><span class="content"> left their nets immediately and followed him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The expression followed him pictures discipleship, which means that to learn from Jesus is to follow him as the guiding priority of one’s life.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="MAT.4.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> Going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “their boat.” The phrase ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ (en tw ploiw) can either refer to a generic boat, some boat (as it seems to do here); or it can refer to “their” boat, implying possession.
