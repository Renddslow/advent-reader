This transformation means the righteous will share the glory of God. One recalls the way Moses shared the Lord’s glory after his visit to the mountain in Exod 34. So the disciples saw Jesus transfigured, and they were getting a sneak preview of the great glory that Jesus would have (only his glory is more inherent to him as one who shares in the rule of the kingdom).</span></span></span><span class="content"> His</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has not been translated.</span></span></span><span class="content"> face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="MAT.17.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Then Moses</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “And behold, Moses.” The Greek word ἰδού (idou) has not been translated because it has no exact English equivalent here, but adds interest and emphasis (BDAG 468 s.v. 1).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and Elijah</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Commentators and scholars discuss why Moses and Elijah are present.

But since ποιήσωμεν is the reading found in the parallel accounts in Mark and Luke, it is almost surely a motivated reading. Further, the earliest and best witnesses, as well as a few others (א B C* 700 pc) have ποιήσω.

As B. M. Metzger notes, “Since there is no satisfactory reason why the passage, if originally present in Matthew, should have been omitted in a wide variety of witnesses, and since copyists frequently inserted material derived from another Gospel, it appears that most manuscripts have been assimilated to the parallel in Mk 9.29” (TCGNT 35). The present translation follows NA27 in omitting the verse number as well, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</span></span></span></span></div>
