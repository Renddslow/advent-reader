The Byzantine text, along with a few others (C[*],2 L W Θ Ë1 33 Ï), conflates earlier readings by calling him “Lebbaeus, who was called Thaddaeus,” while codex 13 pc conflate by way of transposition (“Thaddaeus, who was called Lebbaeus”). But excellent witnesses of the earliest texttypes (א B Ë13 892 pc lat co) call him merely Θαδδαῖος (Qaddaio&quot;, “Thaddaeus”), a reading which, because of this support, is most likely correct.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="MAT.10.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Simon the Zealot</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the Cananean,” but according to both BDAG 507 s.v.

He may not have been technically a member of the particular Jewish nationalistic party known as “Zealots” (since according to some scholars this party had not been organized at that time), but simply someone who was zealous for Jewish independence from Rome, in which case the term would refer to his temperament.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and Judas Iscariot,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn There is some debate about what the name Iscariot means.

Several explanations for the name Iscariot have been proposed, but it is probably transliterated Hebrew with the meaning “man of Kerioth” (there are at least two villages that had that name).

The longer version of this verse is found in several diverse and ancient witnesses such as א B C* (D) N 0281vid Ë1,13 33 565 al lat; P W Δ 348 have a word-order variation, but nevertheless include νεκροὺς ἐγείρετε. Although some Byzantine-text proponents charge the Alexandrian witnesses with theologically-motivated alterations toward heterodoxy, it is interesting to find a variant such as this in which the charge could be reversed (do the Byzantine scribes have something against the miracle of resurrection?). In reality, such charges of wholesale theologically-motivated changes toward heterodoxy are immediately suspect due to lack of evidence of intentional changes (here the change is evidently due to accidental omission).</span></span></span><span class="content"> cleanse lepers, cast out demons.
