The latter reading is an assimilation to the parallel in Mark; the former reading may have been motivated by the clarification needed (especially to give the following αὐτοῦ [autou, “his”] an antecedent). But a few significant mss (א* B L Γ 579 [700] 1424* pc) have neither noun. As the harder reading, it seems to best explain the rise of the others.

Jesus was now in the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas (i.e., Judea and beyond the Jordan) and it is likely that the Pharisees were hoping he might answer the question of divorce in a way similar to John the Baptist and so suffer the same fate as John, i.e., death at the hands of Herod (cf. 14:1-12). Jesus answered the question not on the basis of rabbinic custom and the debate over Deut 24:1, but rather from the account of creation and God’s original design.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="MAT.19.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> He answered, “Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator </span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">made them male and female</span></span></span><span class="content">,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Gen 1:27; 5:2.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="MAT.19.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> and said, ‘</span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh</span></span></span><span class="content">’?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Gen 2:24.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="MAT.19.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

This shorter reading may be due to assimilation to the Markan parallel, but since it is attested in early and diverse witnesses (א D L Z Θ Ë1 579 700 pc lat) and since the parallel verse (Mark 10:4) already departs at many points, the shorter reading seems more likely to be original. The pronoun has been included in the translation, however, for clarity. NA27 includes the word in brackets, indicating reservations regarding its authenticity.sn A quotation from Deut 24:1. The Pharisees were all in agreement that the OT permitted a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce his wife (not vice-versa) and that remarriage was therefore sanctioned. But the two rabbinic schools of Shammai and Hillel differed on the grounds for divorce. Shammai was much stricter than Hillel and permitted divorce only in the case of sexual immorality. Hillel permitted divorce for almost any reason (cf. the Mishnah, m. Gittin 9.10).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="MAT.19.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> Jesus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc A few important mss (א Φ pc) have the name “Jesus” here, but it is probably not original.
