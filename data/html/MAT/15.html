But such expansions are generally motivated readings; in this case, most likely it was due to the wording of the previous verse (“the commandment of God”) that caused early scribes to add to the text. Although it is possible that other witnesses reduced the text to the simple εἶπεν (eipen, “[God] said”) because of perceived redundancy with the statement in v. 3, such is unlikely in light of the great variety and age of these authorities (א1 B D Θ 073 Ë1,13 579 700 892 pc lat co, as well as other versions and fathers).</span></span></span><span class="content"> ‘</span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">Honor your father and mother</span></span></span><span class="content">’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and ‘</span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death</span></span></span><span class="content">.’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Exod 21:17; Lev 20:9.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="MAT.15.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> But you say, ‘If someone tells his father or mother, “Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “is a gift,” that is, something dedicated to God.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="MAT.15.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> he does not need to honor his father.’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The logic of v. 5 would seem to demand that both father and mother are in view in v. 6. Indeed, the majority of mss (C L W Θ 0106 Ë1 Ï) have “or his mother” (ἢ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, h thn mhtera autou) after “honor his father” here. However, there are significant witnesses that have variations on this theme (καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ [kai thn mhtera autou, “and his mother”] in Φ 565 1241 pc and ἢ τὴν μητέρα [“or mother”] in 073 Ë13 33 579 700 892 pc), which is usually an indication of a predictable addition to the text rather than an authentic reading. Further, the shorter reading (without any mention of “mother”) is found in early and important witnesses (א B D sa). Although it is possible that the shorter reading came about accidentally (due to the repetition of –ερα αὐτοῦ), the evidence more strongly suggests that the longer readings were intentional scribal alterations.tn Grk “he will never honor his father.” Here Jesus is quoting the Pharisees, whose intent is to release the person who is giving his possessions to God from the family obligation of caring for his parents. The verb in this phrase is future tense, and it is negated with οὐ μή (ou mh), the strongest negation possible in Greek. A literal translation of the phrase does not capture the intended sense of the statement; it would actually make the Pharisees sound as if they agreed with Jesus. Instead, a more interpretive translation has been used to focus upon the release from family obligations that the Pharisees allowed in these circumstances.sn Here Jesus refers to something that has been set aside as a gift to be given to God at some later date, but which is still in the possession of the owner. According to contemporary Jewish tradition, the person who made this claim was absolved from responsibility to support or assist his parents, a clear violation of the Mosaic law to honor one’s parents (v. 4).</span></span></span><span class="content"> You have nullified the word of God on account of your tradition. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="MAT.15.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> Hypocrites!

The shorter reading is read by א*,2 B D 0237 Epiph. There is a distinct possibility of omission due to homoioarcton in א*; this manuscript has a word order variation which puts the word τυφλοί (tufloi, “blind”) right before the word τυφλῶν (tuflwn, “of the blind”). This does not explain the shorter reading, however, in the other witnesses, of which B and D are quite weighty. Internal considerations suggest that the shorter reading is original: “of the blind” was likely added by scribes to balance this phrase with Jesus’ following statement about the blind leading the blind, which clearly has two groups in view. A decision is difficult, but internal considerations here along with the strength of the witnesses argue that the shorter reading is more likely original.
