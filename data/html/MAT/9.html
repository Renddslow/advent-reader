On the one hand to declare sins are forgiven is easier, since one does not need to see it, unlike telling a paralyzed person to walk. On the other hand, it is harder, because for it to be true one must possess the authority to forgive the sin.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’? </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="MAT.9.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> But so that you may know</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Now Jesus put the two actions together.

It is Jesus’ favorite way to refer to himself. Jesus did not reveal the background of the term here, which mixes human and divine imagery as the man in Daniel rides a cloud, something only God does. He just used it. It also could be an idiom in Aramaic meaning either “some person” or “me.” So there is a little ambiguity in its use here, since its origin is not clear at this point. However, the action makes it clear that Jesus used it to refer to himself here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> has authority on earth to forgive sins” – then he said to the paralytic</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Jesus did not finish his sentence with words but with action, that is, healing the paralytic with an accompanying pronouncement to him directly.</span></span></span><span class="content"> – “Stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to your house.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="MAT.9.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> And he stood up and went home.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to his house.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="MAT.9.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> When</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here δέ (de) has not been translated.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the crowd saw this, they were afraid</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc Most witnesses (C L Θ 0233 Ë13 Ï) have ἐθαύμασαν (eqaumasan; “marveled, were amazed”) instead of ἐφοβήθησαν (efobhqhsan) here, effectively turning the fearful reaction into one of veneration.

There was a tax booth in Capernaum, which was on the trade route from Damascus to Galilee and the Mediterranean. The “taxes” were collected on produce and goods brought into the area for sale, and were a sort of “sales tax” paid by the seller but obviously passed on to the purchaser in the form of increased prices (L&amp;N 57.183). It was here that Jesus met Matthew (also named Levi [see Mark 2:14, Luke 5:27]) who was ultimately employed by the Romans, though perhaps more directly responsible to Herod Antipas. It was his job to collect taxes for Rome and he was thus despised by Jews who undoubtedly regarded him as a traitor.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Follow me,” he said to him.
