                >tc The LXX of Jer 38:15 (31:15 ET) has “lamentation, weeping, and loud wailing”;
                most later mss (C D L W 0233 Ë13 33 Ï) have a quotation in Matthew which conforms to
                that of the LXX (θρῆνος καὶ κλαυθμός καὶ ὀδυρμός; qrhno&quot; kai klauqmo&quot; kai
                odurmo&quot;). But such assimilations were routine among the scribes; as such, they
                typically should be discounted because they are both predictable and motivated. The
                shorter reading, without “lamentation and,” is thus to be preferred, especially
                since it cannot easily be accounted for unless it is the original wording here.
                Further, it is found in the better mss along with a good cross-section of other
                witnesses (א B Z 0250 Ë1 pc lat co).</span
