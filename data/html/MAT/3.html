While his clothing and diet were indicative of someone who lived in the desert, they also depicted him in his role as God’s prophet (cf. Zech 13:4); his appearance is similar to the Prophet Elijah (2 Kgs 1:8). Locusts and wild honey were a common diet in desert regions, and locusts (dried insects) are listed in Lev 11:22 among the “clean” foods.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="MAT.3.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Then people from Jerusalem,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Then Jerusalem.”map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</span></span></span><span class="content"> as well as all Judea and all the region around the Jordan, were going out to him, </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="MAT.3.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> and he was baptizing them</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “they were being baptized by him.” The passive construction has been rendered as active in the translation for the sake of English style.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.</span></span></div>

There were more Pharisees than Sadducees (according to Josephus, Ant. 17.2.4 [17.42] there were more than 6,000 Pharisees at about this time). Pharisees differed with Sadducees on certain doctrines and patterns of behavior. The Pharisees were strict and zealous adherents to the laws of the OT and to numerous additional traditions such as angels and bodily resurrection.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and Sadducees</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Sadducees controlled the official political structures of Judaism at this time, being the majority members of the Sanhedrin. They were known as extremely strict on law and order issues (Josephus, J. W. 2.8.2 [2.119], 2.8.14 [2.164-166]; Ant. 13.5.9 [13.171-173], 13.10.6 [13.293-298], 18.1.2 [18.11], 18.1.4 [18.16-17], 20.9.1 [20.199]; Life 2 [10-11]).

This was considered one of the least worthy tasks of a slave, and John did not consider himself worthy to do even that for the one to come, despite the fact he himself was a prophet.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn With the Holy Spirit and fire. There are differing interpretations for this phrase regarding the number of baptisms and their nature. (1) Some see one baptism here, and this can be divided further into two options. (a) The baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire could refer to the cleansing, purifying work of the Spirit in the individual believer through salvation and sanctification, or (b) it could refer to two different results of Christ’s ministry: Some accept Christ and are baptized with the Holy Spirit, but some reject him and receive judgment. (2) Other interpreters see two baptisms here: The baptism of the Holy Spirit refers to the salvation Jesus brings at his first advent, in which believers receive the Holy Spirit, and the baptism of fire refers to the judgment Jesus will bring upon the world at his second coming. One must take into account both the image of fire and whether individual or corporate baptism is in view. A decision is not easy on either issue. The image of fire is used to refer to both eternal judgment (e.g., Matt 25:41) and the power of the Lord’s presence to purge and cleanse his people (e.g., Isa 4:4-5). The pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost, a fulfillment of this prophecy no matter which interpretation is taken, had both individual and corporate dimensions. It is possible that since Holy Spirit and fire are governed by a single preposition in Greek, the one-baptism view may be more likely, but this is not certain. Simply put, there is no consensus view in scholarship at this time on the best interpretation of this passage.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="MAT.3.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> His winnowing fork</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A winnowing fork was a pitchfork-like tool used to toss threshed grain in the air so that the wind blew away the chaff, leaving the grain to fall to the ground.
