                all who believe (cf. Rom 1:16).</span

                Cristou, “the gospel of Jesus Christ”) could be translated as either a subjective
                genitive (“the gospel which Jesus brings [or proclaims]”) or an objective genitive
                (“the gospel about Jesus Christ”). Either is grammatically possible. This is
                possibly an instance of a plenary genitive (see ExSyn 119-21; M. Zerwick, Biblical
                Greek, §§36-39). If so, an interplay between the two concepts is intended: The
                gospel which Jesus proclaims is in fact the gospel about himself.</span

                virtually all the rest of the witnesses have the words (A Ë1,13 33 Ï also have τοῦ
                [tou] before θεοῦ), so the evidence seems to argue for the authenticity of the
                words. Most likely, the words were omitted by accident in some witnesses, since the
                last four words of v. 1, in uncial script, would have looked like this:
                iu_c_r_u_u_u_q_u_. With all the successive upsilons an accidental deletion is
                likely. Further, the inclusion of υἱοῦ θεοῦ here finds its complement in 15:39,
                where the centurion claims that Jesus was υἱὸς θεοῦ (Juios qeou, “son of God”). Even
                though א is in general one of the best NT mss, its testimony is not quite as
                preeminent in this situation. There are several other instances in which it breaks
                up chains of genitives ending in ου (cf., e.g., Acts 28:31; Col 2:2; Heb 12:2; Rev
                12:14; 15:7; 22:1), showing that there is a significantly higher possibility of
                accidental scribal omission in a case like this. This christological inclusio
                parallels both Matthew (“Immanuel…God with us” in 1:23/“I am with you” in 28:20) and
                John (“the Word was God” in 1:1/“My Lord and my God” in 20:28), probably reflecting
                nascent christological development and articulation.sn The first verse of Mark’s
                Gospel appears to function as a title: The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
                the Son of God. It is not certain, however, whether Mark intended it to refer to the
                entire Gospel, to the ministry of John the Baptist, or through the use of the term
                beginning (ἀρχή, arch) to allude to Genesis 1:1 (in the Greek Bible, LXX). The most
                likely option is that the statement as a whole is an allusion to Genesis 1:1 and
                that Mark is saying that with the “good news” of the coming of Christ, God is
                commencing a “new beginning.”</span

                >tc Instead of “in Isaiah the prophet” the majority of mss read “in the prophets” (A
                W Ë13 Ï Irlat). Except for Irenaeus (2nd century), the earliest evidence for this is
                thus from the 5th (or possibly late 4th) century (W A). The difficulty of Irenaeus
                is that he wrote in Greek but has been preserved largely in Latin. His Greek remains
                have “in Isaiah the prophet.” Only the later Latin translation has “in the
                prophets.” The KJV reading is thus in harmony with the majority of late mss. On the
                other hand, the witnesses for “in Isaiah the prophet” (either with the article
                before Isaiah or not) are early and geographically widespread: א B D L Δ Θ Ë1 33 565
                700 892 1241 2427 al syp co Ir. This evidence runs deep into the 2nd century, is
                widespread, and is found in the most important Alexandrian, Western, and Caesarean
                witnesses. The “Isaiah” reading has a better external pedigree in every way. It has
                the support of the earliest and best witnesses from all the texttypes that matter.
                Moreover it is the harder reading, since the quotation in the first part of the
                verse appears to be from Exod 23:20 and Mal 3:1, with the quotation from Isa 40:3
                coming in the next verse. The reading of the later mss seems motivated by a desire
                to resolve this difficulty.</span

                gospel of the kingdom of God.” On the one hand, it is perhaps possible that τῆς
                βασιλείας was omitted to conform the expression to that which is found in the
                epistles (cf. Rom 1:1; 15:16; 2 Cor 11:7; 1 Thess 2:2, 8, 9; 1 Pet 4:17). On the
                other hand, this expression, “the gospel of God,” occurs nowhere else in the
                Gospels, while “the gospel of the kingdom” is a Matthean expression (Matt 4:23;
                9:35; 24:14), and “kingdom of God” is pervasive in the synoptic Gospels (occurring
                over 50 times). Scribes would thus be more prone to add τῆς βασιλείας than to omit
                it. Further, the external support for the shorter reading (א B L Θ Ë1,13 28* 33 565
                579 892 2427 sa) is significantly stronger than that for the longer reading. There
                is little doubt, therefore, that the shorter reading is authentic.</span

                both men and women, thus “people.”sn The kind of fishing envisioned was net – not
                line – fishing (cf. v. 16; cf. also BDAG 55 s.v. ἀμφιβάλλω, ἀμφίβληστρον) which
                involved a circular net that had heavy weights around its perimeter. The occupation
                of fisherman was labor-intensive. The imagery of using a lure and a line (and
                waiting for the fish to strike) is thus foreign to this text. Rather, the imagery of
                a fisherman involved much strain, long hours, and often little results. Jesus’ point
                may have been one or more of the following: the strenuousness of evangelism, the
                work ethic that it required, persistence and dedication to the task (often in spite
                of minimal results), the infinite value of the new “catch” (viz., people), and
                perhaps an eschatological theme of snatching people from judgment (cf. W. L. Lane,
                Mark [NICNT], 67). If this last motif is in view, then catching people is the
                opposite of catching fish: The fish would be caught, killed, cooked, and eaten;
                people would be caught so as to remove them from eternal destruction and to give
                them new life.</span

                could establish a synagogue if there were at least ten men. In normative Judaism of
                the NT period, the OT scripture was read and discussed in the synagogue by the men
                who were present. (See the Mishnah, m. Megillah 3-4; m. Berakhot 2.) First came the
                law, then the prophets, then someone was asked to speak on the texts. Jesus
                undoubtedly took the opportunity on this occasion to speak about his person and

                >tn Grk “What to us and to you?” This is an idiom meaning, “We have nothing to do
                with one another,” or “Why bother us!” The phrase τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί (ti Jhmin kai soi)
                is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BDAG 275 s.v.
                ἐγώ). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When
                one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say “What to me
                and to you?” meaning, “What have I done to you that you should do this to me?” (Judg
                11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a
                matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, “What
                to me and to you?” meaning, “That is your business, how am I involved?” (2 Kgs 3:13,
                Hos 14:8). Option (1) implies hostility, while option (2) merely implies
                disengagement. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: What have
                I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! Hostility
                between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence
                the translation: “Leave me alone….” For a very similar expression see Lk 8:28 and
                (in a different context) John 2:4.</span

                codex D has “they knew him and he healed many who were sick with various diseases
                and drove out many demons,” reproducing exactly the first half of the verse. These
                first two longer readings are predictable expansions to an enticingly brief
                statement; the fact that there are significant variations on the word order and
                presence or absence of τόν argues against their authenticity as well. D’s reading is
                a palpable error of sight. The reading adopted in the translation is supported by א*

                is more difficult to account for a change from “moved with compassion” to “moved
                with anger” than it is for a copyist to soften “moved with anger” to “moved with
                compassion,” making the decision quite difficult. B. M. Metzger (TCGNT 65) suggests
                that “moved with anger” could have been prompted by 1:43, “Jesus sent the man away
                with a very strong warning.” It also could have been prompted by the man’s seeming
                doubt about Jesus’ desire to heal him (v. 40). As well, it is difficult to explain
                why scribes would be prone to soften the text here but not in Mark 3:5 or 10:14
                (where Jesus is also said to be angry or indignant). Thus, in light of diverse mss
                supporting “moved with compassion,” and at least a plausible explanation for
                ὀργισθείς as arising from the other reading, it is perhaps best to adopt
                σπλαγχνισθείς as the original reading. Nevertheless, a decision in this case is not
                easy. For the best arguments for ὀργισθείς, however, see M. A. Proctor, “The
                ‘Western’ Text of Mark 1:41: A Case for the Angry Jesus” (Ph.D. diss., Baylor
                University, 1999).</span
