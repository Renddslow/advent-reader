In general, parables usually advance a single idea, though there may be many parts and characters in a single parable and subordinate ideas may expand the main idea further. The beauty of using the parable as a teaching device is that it draws the listener into the story, elicits an evaluation, and demands a response.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and in his teaching said to them: </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="MRK.4.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> “Listen!

The background for this well-known parable, drawn from a typical scene in the Palestinian countryside, is a field through which a well worn path runs. Sowing would occur in late fall or early winter (October to December) in the rainy season, looking for sprouting in April or May and a June harvest. The use of seed as a figure for God’s giving life has OT roots (Isa 55:10-11). The point of the parable of the sower is to illustrate the various responses to the message of the kingdom of God (cf. 4:11).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="MRK.4.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> And as he sowed, some seed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Mark’s version of the parable, like Luke’s (cf.

Some understand the parable as a reference to evangelism. While this is certainly involved, it does not seem to be the central idea. In contrast to the parable of the sower which emphasizes the quality of the different soils, this parable emphasizes the power of the seed to cause growth (with the clear implication that the mysterious growth of the kingdom is accomplished by God), apart from human understanding and observation.</span></span></span></span></div>

Also, there is important OT background in the image of the mustard seed that grew and became a tree: Ezek 17:22-24 pictures the reemergence of the Davidic house where people can find calm and shelter.
