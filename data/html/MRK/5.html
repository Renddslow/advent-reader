Most later mss (A C Ë13 Ï syp,h) read “Gadarenes,” which is the better reading in Matt 8:28. Other mss (א2 L Δ Θ Ë1 28 33 565 579 700 892 1241 1424 al sys bo) have “Gergesenes.” Others (א* B D latt sa) have “Gerasenes,” which is the reading followed in the translation here and in Luke 8:26. The difference between Matthew and Mark (which is parallel to Luke) may well have to do with uses of variant regional terms.sn The region of the Gerasenes would be in Gentile territory on the (south)eastern side of the Sea of Galilee across from Galilee. Matthew 8:28 records this miracle as occurring “in the region of the Gadarenes.” “Irrespective of how one settles this issue, for the [second and] Third Evangelist the chief concern is that Jesus has crossed over into Gentile territory, ‘opposite Galilee’” (J. B. Green, Luke [NICNT], 337). The region of Gadara extended to the Sea of Galilee and included the town of Sennabris on the southern shore – the town that the herdsmen most likely entered after the drowning of the pigs.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="MRK.5.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Just as Jesus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he”; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Unclean spirit refers to an evil spirit.</span></span></span><span class="content"> came from the tombs and met him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “met him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.” When this is converted to normal English word order (“a man met him from the tombs with an unclean spirit”) it sounds as if “with an unclean spirit” modifies “the tombs.” Likewise, “a man with an unclean spirit from the tombs met him” implies that the unclean spirit came from the tombs, while the Greek text is clear that it is the man who had the unclean spirit who came from the tombs. To make this clear a second verb, “came,” is supplied in English: “came from the tombs and met him.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="MRK.5.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="MRK.5.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he had often been bound with chains and shackles.” “Shackles” could also be translated “fetters”; they were chains for the feet.</span></span></span><span class="content"> but</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “and.” Here καί (kai) has been translated as “but” to indicate the contrast present in this context.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces.

The phrase τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί (ti emoi kai soi) is Semitic in origin, though it made its way into colloquial Greek (BDAG 275 s.v. ἐγώ). The equivalent Hebrew expression in the OT had two basic meanings: (1) When one person was unjustly bothering another, the injured party could say “What to me and to you?” meaning, “What have I done to you that you should do this to me?” (Judg 11:12, 2 Chr 35:21, 1 Kgs 17:18). (2) When someone was asked to get involved in a matter he felt was no business of his own, he could say to the one asking him, “What to me and to you?” meaning, “That is your business, how am I involved?” (2 Kgs 3:13, Hos 14:8). These nuances were apparently expanded in Greek, but the basic notions of defensive hostility (option 1) and indifference or disengagement (option 2) are still present. BDAG suggests the following as glosses for this expression: What have I to do with you? What have we in common? Leave me alone! Never mind! Hostility between Jesus and the demons is certainly to be understood in this context, hence the translation: “Leave me alone….”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Jesus, Son of the Most High God!

However, this is another example of a miracle that is a visual lesson. The demons are destructive: They were destroying the man. They destroyed the pigs. They destroy whatever they touch. The point was to take demonic influence seriously, as well as Jesus’ power over it as a picture of the larger battle for human souls.
