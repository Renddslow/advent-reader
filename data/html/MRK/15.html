The known scribal tendency to assimilate one synoptic passage to another parallel, coupled with the lack of such assimilation in mss that are otherwise known to do this most frequently (the Western and Byzantine texts), suggests that θέλετε is authentic. Further, Mark’s known style of being generally more verbose and redundant than Matthew’s argues that θέλετε is authentic here. That this is the longer reading, however, and that a good variety of witnesses omit the word, gives one pause. Perhaps the wording without θέλετε would have been perceived as having greater homiletical value, motivating scribes to move in this direction. A decision is difficult, but on the whole internal evidence leads toward regarding θέλετε as authentic.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with the one you call king of the Jews?” </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="MRK.15.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> They shouted back, “Crucify</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Crucifixion was the cruelest form of punishment practiced by the Romans.

The victim was stripped of his clothes and bound to a post with his hands fastened above him (or sometimes he was thrown to the ground). Guards standing on either side of the victim would incessantly beat him with a whip (flagellum) made out of leather with pieces of lead and bone inserted into its ends. While the Jews only allowed 39 lashes, the Romans had no such limit; many people who received such a beating died as a result. See C.

Others may have inherited it, like Paul.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who stood in front of him, saw how he died,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the way he breathed his last”; or “the way he expired”; or “that he thus breathed no more.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!” </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="MRK.15.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content"> There were also women, watching from a distance.
