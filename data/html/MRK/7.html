Although normally the shorter reading is to be preferred, especially when it is backed by excellent witnesses as in this case, there are some good reasons to consider καὶ κλινῶν as authentic: (1) Although the addition of κλινῶν could be seen as motivated by a general assimilation to the purity regulations in Lev 15 (as some have argued), there are three problems with such a supposition: (a) the word κλίνη (klinh) does not occur in the LXX of Lev 15; (b) nowhere in Lev 15 is the furniture washed or sprinkled; and (c) the context of Lev 15 is about sexual impurity, while the most recent evidence suggests that κλίνη in Mark 7:4, in keeping with the other terms used here, refers to a dining couch (cf. BDAG 549 s.v. κλίνη 2). Thus, it is difficult to see καὶ κλινῶν as a motivated reading. (2) κλίνη, though a relatively rare term in the NT, is in keeping with Markan usage (cf. Mark 4:21; 7:30). (3) The phrase could have been dropped accidentally, at least in some cases, via homoioteleuton. (4) The phrase may have been deliberately expunged by some scribes who thought the imagery of washing a dining couch quite odd. The longer reading, in this case, can thus be argued as the harder reading. On balance, even though a decision is difficult (especially because of the weighty external evidence for the shorter reading), it is preferable to retain καὶ κλινῶν in the text.</span></span></span><span class="content">)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Verses 3-4 represent parenthetical remarks by the author, giving background information.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="MRK.7.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “eat bread.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> with unwashed hands?” </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="MRK.7.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written:</span></span></div>

Such floating texts are usually signs of scribal emendations. The fact that the earliest and most reliable mss, as well as other important witnesses (Ì45 א B L W Δ 0274 Ë1 2427 co), lacked this material also strongly suggests that the longer reading is secondary.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="MRK.7.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> He also said to them, “You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The translation here follows the reading στήσητε (sthshte, “set up”) found in D W Θ Ë1 28 565 2542 it sys,p Cyp. The majority of mss here read τηρήσητε (thrhsete; א A L Ë13 33 Ï co) or τηρῆτε (thrhte; B 2427), both translated “keep.” It is hard to know which reading is best: On the one hand, τηρήσητε/τηρῆτε has much stronger external support, but στήσητε is a more difficult reading. What makes “keep” suspect is that it appears in two different forms, suggesting independent alterations of a difficult reading. Further, scribes may have been influenced by the preceding “commandment of God” to change the text toward “keep” (TCGNT 81), a common enough expression (cf. Matt 19:17; John 14:15; 1 Tim 6:1; 1 John 5:3; Rev 14:12). Thus, the more difficult reading is “set up.” Also, the more natural opposite of “reject” (ἀθεῖτε [aqeite], literally “you set aside”) is “set up.” However, the Western reading may have been influenced by Exod 6:4 or Heb 10:9, but this likelihood seems remote. Thus, “set up” is more likely to be the original wording of Mark here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> your tradition. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="MRK.7.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> For Moses said, ‘</span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">Honor your father and your mother</span></span></span><span class="content">,’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and, ‘</span><span class="it"><span class="bd"><span class="content">Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death</span></span><span class="content">.</span></span><span class="content">’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Exod 21:17; Lev 20:9.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="MRK.7.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, ‘Whatever help you would have received from me is </span><span class="it"><span class="content">corban</span></span><span class="content">’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Corban is a Hebrew loanword (transliterated in the Greek text and in most modern English translations) referring to something that has been set aside as a gift to be given to God at some later date, but which is still in the possession of the owner (L&amp;N 53.22).

The Western text, as well as several other important mss (D L W Δ Θ 28 565 it), lack the words. Although the external evidence is on the side of inclusion, it is difficult to explain why scribes would omit the mention of Sidon. On the other hand, the parallels in v. 31 and Matt 15:21 would be sufficient motivation for scribes to add Sidon here. Furthermore, every other mention of Tyre in the Gospels is accompanied by Sidon, putting pressure on scribes to conform this text as well. The shorter reading therefore, though without compelling external evidence on its side, is strongly supported by internal evidence, rendering judgment on its authenticity fairly certain.map For location see Map1-A2; Map2-G2; Map4-A1; JP3-F3; JP4-F3.</span></span></span><span class="content"> When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “And.” Here καί (kai) has been translated as “but” to indicate the contrast present in this context.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he was not able to escape notice. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="MRK.7.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content"> Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Unclean spirit refers to an evil spirit.</span></span></span><span class="content"> immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet. </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="MRK.7.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content"> The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin.
