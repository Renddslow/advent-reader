Many commentators, on the basis of similarities between this account of the feeding of the multitude (8:1-10) and that in 6:30-44, have argued that there is only one event referred to in both passages. While there are similarities in language and in the response of the disciples, there are also noticeable differences, including the different number present on each occasion (i.e., 5,000 in chap. 6 and 4,000 here). In the final analysis, the fact that Jesus refers to two distinct feedings in 8:18-20 settles the issue; this passage represents another very similar incident to that recorded in 6:30-44.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="MRK.8.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The exact location of Dalmanutha is uncertain, but it is somewhere close to the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.</span></span></span></span></div>

The first two variants would not be translated differently; the third reading, however, would add “to him” after “they replied.” What complicates the issue is that the external evidence is fairly evenly split between the second and third readings, though the first reading is in agreement with the second reading in lacking the dative pronoun. Indeed, another layout of the problem here could treat this as two distinct problems: καὶ λέγουσιν vs. οἱ δὲ εἶπον and αὐτῷ vs. omission of the word. In this second arrangement of the problem, the reading without the pronoun has slightly stronger support (Ì45 א A D W Θ Ë1,13 33 Ï it). Internally, Mark never elsewhere uses the form εἶπον for the third person plural indicative form of this verb (it is always εἶπαν [eipan]). And although only one other time in Mark is the object lacking after λέγουσιν (6:38), it is a similar context (viz., the disciples’ response before Jesus feeds the 5000). Very tentatively, the reading that is followed here is καὶ λέγουσιν. NA27 puts αὐτῷ in brackets, indicating some doubt as to its authenticity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Seven.” </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="MRK.8.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> Then</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here καί (kai) has been translated as “Then” to indicate the implied sequence in the narrative.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he said to them, “Do you still not understand?”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Do you still not understand?

These predictions form the structure of the section, the content for the section (Jesus’ suffering, death, and the meaning of genuine discipleship) and the mood of the section (i.e., a somber mood). What is interesting is that after each passion prediction, Mark records both the misunderstanding of the disciples and then Jesus’ teaching on the nature of his death and what genuine discipleship is all about: (1) denying oneself (8:34-38); (2) humility and serving (9:33-37); (3) suffering, humble service, and not lording it over people (10:35-45).
