In words familiar to every Jew, the author is indicating that at this point every messianic expectation is now at the point of realization. It is clear from the words of the psalm shouted by the crowd that Jesus is being proclaimed as messianic king. See E. Lohse, TDNT 9:682-84.sn Hosanna is an Aramaic expression that literally means, “help, I pray,” or “save, I pray.” By Jesus’ time it had become a strictly liturgical formula of praise, however, and was used as an exclamation of praise to God.</span></span></span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content"> Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!</span></span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Ps 118:25-26.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="MRK.11.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!

The incident of the cursing of the fig tree occurs before he enters the temple for a third time (11:27ff) and is questioned at length by the religious leaders (11:27-12:40). It appears that Mark records the incident as a portent of what is going to happen to the leadership in Jerusalem who were supposed to have borne spiritual fruit but have been found by Messiah at his coming to be barren. The fact that the nation as a whole is indicted is made explicit in chapter 13:1-37 where Jesus speaks of Jerusalem’s destruction and his second coming.</span></span></span></span></div>

Berakhot 9.5 that Jesus was not even allowing sandals, staffs, or coin-purses to be carried through the court. The difficulty with this interpretation, however, is that it is fundamentally an appeal to Jewish oral tradition (something Jesus rarely sided with) as well as being indiscriminate toward all the worshipers.</span></span></span><span class="content"> through the temple courts.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the temple.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="MRK.11.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> Then he began to teach</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The imperfect ἐδίδασκεν (edidasken) is here taken ingressively.</span></span></span><span class="content"> them and said, “Is it not written: ‘</span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations</span></span></span><span class="content">’?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Isa 56:7.</span></span></span><span class="content"> But you have turned it into </span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">a den</span></span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “a hideout” (see L&amp;N 1.57).</span></span></span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content"> of robbers</span></span></span><span class="content">!”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Jer 7:11. The meaning of Jesus’ statement about making the temple courts a den of robbers probably operates here at two levels.

It is probably an assimilation to Matt 6:15. The present translation follows NA27 in omitting the verse number, a procedure also followed by a number of other modern translations.</span></span></span></span></div>
