BDAG notes that “‘servant’ for ‘slave’ is largely confined to Biblical transl. and early American times…in normal usage at the present time the two words are carefully distinguished” (BDAG 260 s.v.). The most accurate translation is “bondservant” (sometimes found in the ASV for δοῦλος), in that it often indicates one who sells himself into slavery to another. But as this is archaic, few today understand its force.sn Undoubtedly the background for the concept of being the Lord’s slave or servant is to be found in the Old Testament scriptures. For a Jew this concept did not connote drudgery, but honor and privilege. It was used of national Israel at times (Isa 43:10), but was especially associated with famous OT personalities, including such great men as Moses (Josh 14:7), David (Ps 89:3; cf. 2 Sam 7:5, 8) and Elijah (2 Kgs 10:10); all these men were “servants (or slaves) of the Lord.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see JP1-C1; JP2-C1; JP3-C1; JP4-C1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with the overseers</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The overseers (or “church leaders,” L&amp;N 53.71) is another term for the same official position of leadership as the “elder.” This is seen in the interchange of the two terms in Titus 1:6-7 and in Acts 20:17, 28, as well as in the parallels between Titus 1:6-7 and 1 Tim 3:1-7.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and deacons. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PHP.1.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Grace and peace to you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Grace to you and peace.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</span></span></div>

[I am grateful] for your participation…” (see Moffatt; also P. T. O’Brien, Philippians [NIGTC], 58-61). Option (1) is quite similar to the translation above, but sees v. 4a as more or less parenthetical. Option (2) is significantly different in that Paul thanks God because the Philippians remember him rather than when he remembers them.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PHP.1.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> For I am sure of this very thing,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “since I am sure of this very thing.” The verse begins with an adverbial participle that is dependent on the main verb in v. 3 (“I thank”).

To be sure, the pedigree of the witnesses is not nearly as great for the shorter reading (Ì46 D2 1739 1881 Ï), but it explains well the rise of the other reading. Further, it explains the rise of κυρίου (kuriou, “of the Lord”), the reading of F and G (for if these mss had followed a Vorlage with τοῦ θεοῦ, κυρίου would not have been expected). Further, τοῦ θεοῦ is in different locations among the mss; such dislocations are usually signs of scribal additions to the text. Thus, the Byzantine text and a few other witnesses here have the superior reading, and it should be accepted as the original.</span></span></span><span class="content"> fearlessly.</span></span></div>

Hence, there is the likelihood that he experienced a second Roman imprisonment later on (since the belief of the early church was that Paul died under Nero in Rome). If so, then the pastoral letters (1-2 Tim, Titus) could well fit into a life of Paul that goes beyond any descriptions in the book of Acts (which ends with Paul’s first Roman imprisonment). Some have argued that the pastorals cannot be genuine because they cannot fit into the history of Acts.
