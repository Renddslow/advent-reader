(Its proposed meaning is based on an Akkadian cognate annaku.) The tin wall of the vision, if it symbolizes Israel, may suggest weakness and vulnerability to judgment. See S. M. Paul, Amos (Hermeneia), 233-35. The symbolic significance of God holding tin in his hand and then placing tin among the people is unclear. Possibly the term אֲנָךְ in v. 8b is a homonym meaning “grief” (this term is attested in postbiblical Hebrew). In this case there is a wordplay, the אֲנָךְ (“tin”) of the vision suggesting the אֲנָךְ (“grief”) that judgment will bring upon the land. See F. I. Andersen and D. N. Freedman, Amos (AB), 759. Another option is to maintain the meaning “tin” and understand that the Lord has ripped off a piece of the tin wall and placed it in front of all to see. Their citadels, of which the nation was so proud and confident, are nothing more than tin fortresses. The traditional interpretation of these verses (reflected in many English versions) understands the term אֲנָךְ to mean “lead,” and by extension, “plumb line.” In this case, one may translate: “I saw the sovereign one standing by a wall built true to plumb holding a plumb line in his hand. The Lord said to me, ‘What do you see, Amos?’ I said, ‘A plumb line.’ The sovereign one then said, ‘Look, I am about to place a plumb line among my people…’” According to this view, the plumb line symbolizes God’s moral standards by which he will measure Israel to see if they are a straight or crooked wall.</span></span></span><span class="content"> wall holding tin in his hand. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="AMO.7.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” I said, “Tin.” The sovereign One then said,</span></span></div>

See P. King, Amos, Hosea, Micah, 116-17. Since these trees do not grow around Tekoa but rather in the lowlands, another option is that Amos owned other property outside his hometown. In this case, this verse demonstrates his relative wealth and is his response to Amaziah; he did not depend on prophecy as a profession (v. 13).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="AMO.7.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> Then the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> took me from tending</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “from [following] after.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> flocks and gave me this commission,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and the Lord said to me.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> ‘Go!
