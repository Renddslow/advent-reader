The use of the term “destroy” (שַׁחֵת, shakhet) is reminiscent of the Noahic flood (Gen 6:13).

It makes allusion to the garden of the Lord and to the land of Egypt for comparison. Just as the tree in the garden of Eden had awakened Eve’s desire, so the fertile valley attracted Lot. And just as certain memories of Egypt would cause the Israelites to want to turn back and abandon the trek to the promised land, so Lot headed for the good life.</span></span></span><span class="content"> all the way to Zoar. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="GEN.13.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content"> Lot chose for himself the whole region of the Jordan and traveled</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Lot traveled.” The proper name has not been repeated in the translation at this point for stylistic reasons.</span></span></span><span class="content"> toward the east. </span></span></div>

First, two nouns are used to form a hendiadys: “wicked and sinners” means “wicked sinners,” the first word becoming adjectival. The text is saying these were no ordinary sinners; they were wicked sinners, the type that cause pain for others. Then to this phrase is added “against the Lord,” stressing their violation of the laws of heaven and their culpability. Finally, to this is added מְאֹד (mÿ’od, “exceedingly,” translated here as “extremely”).</span></span></span></span></div>

Earlier Lot “looked up” (v. 10), but here Abram is told by God to do so. The repetition of the expression (Heb “lift up the eyes”) here underscores how the Lord will have the last word and actually do for Abram what Abram did for Lot – give him the land.
