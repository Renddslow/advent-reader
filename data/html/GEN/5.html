Its constant theme of the reign of death in the human race is broken once with the account of Enoch, but the genealogy ends with hope for the future through Noah. See further G. F.

Instead of simply saying that Enoch lived, the text observes that he “walked with God.” The rare expression “walked with” (the Hitpael form of the verb הָלָךְ, halakh, “to walk” collocated with the preposition אֶת, ’et, “with”) is used in 1 Sam 25:15 to describe how David’s men maintained a cordial and cooperative relationship with Nabal’s men as they worked and lived side by side in the fields. In Gen 5:22 the phrase suggests that Enoch and God “got along.” This may imply that Enoch lived in close fellowship with God, leading a life of devotion and piety. An early Jewish tradition, preserved in 1 En. 1:9 and alluded to in Jude 14, says that Enoch preached about the coming judgment. See F. S. Parnham, “Walking with God,” EvQ 46 (1974): 117-18.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for 300 years,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Enoch walked with God, after he became the father of Methuselah, [for] 300 years.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and he had other</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “other” is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for stylistic reasons.</span></span></span><span class="content"> sons and daughters. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="GEN.5.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content"> The entire lifetime of Enoch was 365 years. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="GEN.5.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content"> Enoch walked with God, and then he disappeared</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew construction has the negative particle אֵין (’en, “there is not,” “there was not”) with a pronominal suffix, “he was not.” Instead of saying that Enoch died, the text says he no longer was present.</span></span></span><span class="content"> because God took</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The text simply states that God took Enoch.

The letters נ (nun) and ח (heth) pick up the sounds in the name “Noah,” forming a paronomasia on the name. They are not from the same verbal root, and so the connection is only by sound. Lamech’s sentiment reflects the oppression of living under the curse on the ground, but also expresses the hope for relief in some way through the birth of Noah. His words proved to be ironic but prophetic. The relief would come with a new beginning after the flood. See E. G. Kraeling, “The Interpretations of the Name Noah in Genesis 5:29,” JBL 48 (1929): 138-43.</span></span></span><span class="content"> from our labor and from the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has cursed.” </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="GEN.5.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content"> Lamech lived 595 years after he became the father of Noah, and he had other</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “other” is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied for stylistic reasons.</span></span></span><span class="content"> sons and daughters. </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="GEN.5.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content"> The entire lifetime of Lamech was 777 years, and then he died.</span></span></div>
