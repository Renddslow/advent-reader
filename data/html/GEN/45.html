The tension remains as to how the brothers’ wickedness and God’s intentions work together. Clearly God is able to transform the actions of wickedness to bring about some gracious end. But this is saying more than that; it is saying that from the beginning it was God who sent Joseph here. Although harmonization of these ideas remains humanly impossible, the divine intention is what should be the focus. Only that will enable reconciliation.</span></span></span><span class="content"> ahead of you to preserve life! </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="GEN.45.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> For these past two years there has been famine in</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the famine [has been] in the midst of.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the land and for five more years there will be neither plowing nor harvesting. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="GEN.45.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> God sent me</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn God sent me.
