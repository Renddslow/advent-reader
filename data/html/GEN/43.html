This section may reflect how they remembered the impact of his interrogation, whether he asked the specific questions or not. That may be twisting the truth to protect themselves, not wanting to admit that they volunteered the information. (They admitted as much in 42:31, but now they seem to be qualifying that comment.) On the other hand, when speaking to Joseph later (see 44:19), Judah claims that Joseph asked for the information about their family, making it possible that 42:13 leaves out some of the details of their first encounter.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So we answered him in this way.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and we told to him according to these words.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> How could we possibly know</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The infinitive absolute emphasizes the imperfect verbal form, which here is a historic future (that is, future from the perspective of a past time).</span></span></span><span class="content"> that he would say,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Once again the imperfect verbal form is used as a historic future (that is, future from the perspective of past time).</span></span></span><span class="content"> ‘Bring your brother down’?”</span></span></div>
