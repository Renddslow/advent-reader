The story illustrates the limits of Abram’s faith as he tries to obtain a son through social custom. The barrenness of Sarai poses a challenge to Abram’s faith, just as the famine did in chap. 12. As in chap. 12, an Egyptian figures prominently. (Perhaps Hagar was obtained as a slave during Abram’s stay in Egypt.)</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="GEN.16.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> So Sarai said to Abram, “Since</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “look.” The particle הִנֵּה (hinneh) introduces the foundational clause for the imperative to follow.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has prevented me from having children, have sexual relations with</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “enter to.” The expression is a euphemism for sexual relations (also in v. 4).sn The Hebrew expression translated have sexual relations with does not convey the intimacy of other expressions, such as “so and so knew his wife.” Sarai simply sees this as the social custom of having a child through a surrogate. For further discussion see C. F. Fensham, “The Son of a Handmaid in Northwest Semitic,” VT 19 (1969): 312-21.</span></span></span><span class="content"> my servant.

Sarai blamed Abram for Hagar’s attitude, not the pregnancy. Here she expects to be vindicated by the Lord who will prove Abram responsible. A colloquial rendering might be, “God will get you for this.” It may mean that she thought Abram had encouraged the servant girl in her elevated status.</span></span></span></span></div>

However, it is more likely that the angel merely represents the Lord; he can speak for the Lord because he is sent with the Lord’s full authority. In some cases the angel is clearly distinct from the Lord (see Judg 6:11-23). It is not certain if the same angel is always in view. Though the proper name following the noun “angel” makes the construction definite, this may simply indicate that a definite angel sent from the Lord is referred to in any given context. It need not be the same angel on every occasion. Note the analogous expression “the servant of the Lord,” which refers to various individuals in the OT (see BDB 714 s.v. עֶבֶד).</span></span></span><span class="content"> found Hagar near a spring of water in the desert – the spring that is along the road to Shur.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And the angel of the Lord found her near the spring of water in the desert, near the spring on the way to Shur.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="GEN.16.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> He said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She replied, “I’m running away from</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “from the presence of.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> my mistress, Sarai.”</span></span></div>
