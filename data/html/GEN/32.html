Jacob saw a vision of angels just before he left the promised land. Now he encounters angels as he prepares to return to it. The text does not give the details of the encounter, but Jacob’s response suggests it was amicable. This location was a spot where heaven made contact with earth, and where God made his presence known to the patriarch. See C. Houtman, “Jacob at Mahanaim: Some Remarks on Genesis XXXII 2-3,” VT 28 (1978): 37-44.</span></span></span><span class="content"> met him. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="GEN.32.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Jacob said when he saw them.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Mahanaim apparently means “two camps.” Perhaps the two camps were those of God and of Jacob.</span></span></span></span></div>

The name would evoke the memory of the fight and what it meant. A. Dillmann says that ever after this the name would tell the Israelites that, when Jacob contended successfully with God, he won the battle with man (Genesis, 2:279). To be successful with God meant that he had to be crippled in his own self-sufficiency (A. P.
