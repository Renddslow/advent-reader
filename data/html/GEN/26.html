Many scholars do not believe there were three similar incidents, only one that got borrowed and duplicated. Many regard the account about Isaac as the original, which then was attached to the more important person, Abraham, with supernatural elements being added. For a critique of such an approach, see R. Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative, 47-62. It is more likely that the story illustrates the proverb “like father, like son” (see T. W. Mann, The Book of the Torah, 53). In typical human fashion the son follows his father’s example of lying to avoid problems. The appearance of similar events reported in a similar way underscores the fact that the blessing has now passed to Isaac, even if he fails as his father did.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="GEN.26.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Do not go down to Egypt.

But the Hitpael is better understood here as reflexive/reciprocal, “will bless [i.e., pronounce blessings on] themselves/one another” (see also Gen 22:18). Elsewhere the Hitpael of the verb “to bless” is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 12:2 predicts that Abram will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae. For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11. Earlier formulations of this promise (see Gen 12:2; 18:18) use the Niphal stem. (See also Gen 28:14.)</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="GEN.26.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> All this will come to pass</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “All this will come to pass” are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for stylistic reasons.</span></span></span><span class="content"> because Abraham obeyed me</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “listened to my voice.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn My charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. The language of this verse is clearly interpretive, for Abraham did not have all these laws. The terms are legal designations for sections of the Mosaic law and presuppose the existence of the law. Some Rabbinic views actually conclude that Abraham had fulfilled the whole law before it was given (see m. Qiddushin 4:14). Some scholars argue that this story could only have been written after the law was given (C. Westermann, Genesis, 2:424-25). But the simplest explanation is that the narrator (traditionally taken to be Moses the Lawgiver) elaborated on the simple report of Abraham’s obedience by using terms with which the Israelites were familiar. In this way he depicts Abraham as the model of obedience to God’s commands, whose example Israel should follow.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="GEN.26.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> So Isaac settled in Gerar.</span></span></div>

Here it depicts an action, probably caressing or fondling, that indicated immediately that Rebekah was Isaac’s wife, not his sister. Isaac’s deception made a mockery of God’s covenantal promise. Ignoring God’s promise to protect and bless him, Isaac lied to protect himself and acted in bad faith to the men of Gerar.</span></span></span><span class="content"> his wife Rebekah. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="GEN.26.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “She is really</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Surely, look!” See N.

Because of the parallels between this earlier story and the account in 26:26-33, some scholars see chaps. 21 and 26 as two versions (or doublets) of one original story. However, if one takes the text as it stands, it appears that Isaac made a later treaty agreement with the people of the land that was similar to his father’s. Abraham dug a well at the site and named the place Beer Sheba; Isaac dug another well there and named the well Shibah. Later generations then associated the name Beer Sheba with Isaac, even though Abraham gave the place its name at an earlier time.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to this day.</span></span></div>
