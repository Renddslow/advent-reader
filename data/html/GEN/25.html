The name (since it is a verb) probably means something like “may he protect,” that is, as a rearguard, dogging the heels. It did not have a negative connotation until Esau redefined it. This name was probably chosen because of the immediate association with the incident of grabbing the heel.

In contrast to Esau, a man of the field, Jacob was civilized, as the phrase “living in tents” signifies.

There are some significant words and wordplays in this story that help clarify the points of the story. The verb “cook” is זִיד (zid), which sounds like the word for “hunter” (צַיִד, tsayid). This is deliberate, for the hunter becomes the hunted in this story. The word זִיד means “to cook, to boil,” but by the sound play with צַיִד it comes to mean “set a trap by cooking.” The usage of the word shows that it can also have the connotation of acting presumptuously (as in boiling over). This too may be a comment on the scene. For further discussion of the rhetorical devices in the Jacob narratives, see J. P. Fokkelman, Narrative Art in Genesis (SSN).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and when Esau came in from the open fields, he was famished. </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="GEN.25.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content"> So Esau said to Jacob, “Feed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The rare term לָעַט (la’at), translated “feed,” is used in later Hebrew for feeding animals (see Jastrow, 714).

Famished Esau comes in from the hunt, only to enter the trap.

The writer can use the word “red” to describe the stew that Esau gasped for to convey the nature of Esau and his descendants. They were a lusty, passionate, and profane people who lived for the moment.
