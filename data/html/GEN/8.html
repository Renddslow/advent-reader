Perhaps (1) the preposition should be translated “among,” or (2) the plural “mountains” should be understood in the sense of “mountain range” (see E. A. Speiser, Genesis [AB], 53). A more probable option (3) is that the plural indicates an indefinite singular, translated “one of the mountains” (see GKC 400 §124.o).sn Ararat is the Hebrew name for Urartu, the name of a mountainous region located north of Mesopotamia in modern day eastern Turkey. See E. M. Yamauchi, Foes from the Northern Frontier (SBA), 29-32; G. J. Wenham, Genesis (WBC), 1:184-85; C.

Since in English “had made” could refer to either the ark or the window, the order of the phrases was reversed in the translation to clarify that the window is the referent.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="GEN.8.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> and sent out a raven; it kept flying</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and it went out, going out and returning.” The Hebrew verb יָצָא (yatsa’), translated here “flying,” is modified by two infinitives absolute indicating that the raven went back and forth.</span></span></span><span class="content"> back and forth until the waters had dried up on the earth.</span></span></div>

F. D. Maurice includes a chapter on the sacrifice of Noah in The Doctrine of Sacrifice. The whole burnt offering, according to Leviticus 1, represented the worshiper’s complete surrender and dedication to the Lord. After the flood Noah could see that God was not only a God of wrath, but a God of redemption and restoration. The one who escaped the catastrophe could best express his gratitude and submission through sacrificial worship, acknowledging God as the sovereign of the universe.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="GEN.8.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> And the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> smelled the soothing aroma</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Lord “smelled” (וַיָּרַח, vayyarakh) a “soothing smell” (רֵיחַ הַנִּיהֹחַ, reakh hannihoakh).
