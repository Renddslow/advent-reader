Here, in the thirteenth year, they refused to send the tribute (just as later Hezekiah rebelled against Assyria). And so in the fourteenth year the eastern powers came to put them down again.

A. Speiser (Genesis [AB], 103) suggests that part of this chapter came from an outside source since it refers to Abram the Hebrew. That is not impossible, given that the narrator likely utilized traditions and genealogies that had been collected and transmitted over the years. The meaning of the word “Hebrew” has proved elusive. It may be related to the verb “to cross over,” perhaps meaning “immigrant.” Or it might be derived from the name of Abram’s ancestor Eber (see Gen 11:14-16).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Now Abram was living by the oaks</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “terebinths.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Mamre the Amorite, the brother</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “a brother”; or “a relative”; or perhaps “an ally.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Eshcol and Aner.

If so, it would be a very figurative use: “he emptied out” (or perhaps “unsheathed”) his men. The LXX has “mustered” (cf. NEB). E. A. Speiser (Genesis [AB], 103-4) suggests reading with the Samaritan Pentateuch a verb diq, cognate with Akkadian deku, “to mobilize” troops. If this view is accepted, one must assume that a confusion of the Hebrew letters ד (dalet) and ר (resh) led to the error in the traditional Hebrew text. These two letters are easily confused in all phases of ancient Hebrew script development. The present translation is based on this view.</span></span></span><span class="content"> his 318 trained men who had been born in his household, and he pursued the invaders</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “the invaders” have been supplied in the translation for clarification.</span></span></span><span class="content"> as far as Dan.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The use of the name Dan reflects a later perspective.

But Melchizedek remains an enigma. In a book filled with genealogical records he appears on the scene without a genealogy and then disappears from the narrative.
