The idiom of “built up” here refers to having a family (see Gen 16:2, as well as Ruth 4:11 and BDB 125 s.v. בָנָה).</span></span></span></span></div>

He has responded to my prayer</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and also he has heard my voice.” The expression means that God responded positively to Rachel’s cry and granted her request.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and given me a son.” That is why</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “therefore.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> she named him Dan.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Dan means “he vindicated” or “he judged.” The name plays on the verb used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse. The verb translated “vindicated” is from דִּין (din, “to judge, to vindicate”), the same verbal root from which the name is derived. Rachel sensed that God was righting the wrong.</span></span></span></span></div>

See J. Skinner, Genesis (ICC), 387.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So she named him Naphtali.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Naphtali (נַפְתָּלִי, naftali) must mean something like “my struggle” in view of the statement Rachel made in the preceding clause. The name plays on this earlier statement, “[with] a mighty struggle I have struggled with my sister.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The Qere (marginal reading) means “good fortune has arrived.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> So she named him Gad.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Gad (גָּד, gad) means “good fortune.” The name reflects Leah’s feeling that good fortune has come her way, as expressed in her statement recorded earlier in the verse.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="GEN.30.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Then Leah’s servant Zilpah gave Jacob another son.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and Zilpah, the servant of Leah, bore a second son for Jacob.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="GEN.30.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> Leah said, “How happy I am,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew statement apparently means “with my happiness.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> for women</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “daughters.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> will call me happy!” So she named him Asher.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Asher (אָשֶׁר, ’asher) apparently means “happy one.” The name plays on the words used in the statement which appears earlier in the verse. Both the Hebrew noun and verb translated “happy” and “call me happy,” respectively, are derived from the same root as the name Asher.</span></span></span></span></div>

The imperfect verbal form has a permissive nuance here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="GEN.30.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> When Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “must come in to me.” The imperfect verbal form has an obligatory nuance here.

In direct discourse the more euphemistic “sleep with” was used, but here in the narrative “marital relations” reflects more clearly the emphasis on sexual intercourse.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with her that night. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="GEN.30.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> God paid attention</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “listened to.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to Leah; she became pregnant</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “she conceived” (also in v. 19).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and gave Jacob a son for the fifth time.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and she bore for Jacob a fifth son,” i.e., this was the fifth son that Leah had given Jacob.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="GEN.30.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> Then Leah said, “God has granted me a reward</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “God has given my reward.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> because I gave my servant to my husband as a wife.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “as a wife” are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied for clarity (cf. v. 9).sn Leah seems to regard the act of giving her servant Zilpah to her husband as a sacrifice, for which (she believes) God is now rewarding her with the birth of a son.</span></span></span><span class="content"> So she named him Issachar.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Issachar (יְשָּׁשכָר, yishakhar) appears to mean “man of reward” or possibly “there is reward.” The name plays on the word used in the statement made earlier in the verse. The Hebrew noun translated “reward” is derived from the same root as the name Issachar. The irony is that Rachel thought the mandrakes would work for her, and she was willing to trade one night for them. But in that one night Leah became pregnant.</span></span></span></span></div>

Now my husband will honor me because I have given him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The name Zebulun (זְבֻלוּן, zevulun) apparently means “honor.” The name plays on the verb used in the statement made earlier in the verse. The Hebrew verb translated “will honor” and the name Zebulun derive from the same root.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="GEN.30.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> After that she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.</span></span></div>

In Hebrew the name sounds like the verb (אָסַף,’asasf) translated “taken away” in the earlier statement made in v. 23. So the name, while reflecting Rachel’s hope, was also a reminder that God had removed her shame.</span></span></span><span class="content"> saying, “May the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> give me yet another son.”</span></span></div>

E. A.

It was generally believed that placing such “visual aids” before the animals as they were mating, it was possible to influence the appearance of their offspring. E. A. Speiser notes that “Jacob finds a way to outwit his father-in-law, through prenatal conditioning of the flock by visual aids – in conformance with universal folk beliefs” (Genesis [AB], 238).
