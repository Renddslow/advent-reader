However, as the story unfolds the place is transformed into a holy place. See A. P. Ross, “Jacob’s Vision: The Founding of Bethel,” BSac 142 (1985): 224-37.</span></span></span><span class="content"> where he decided to camp because the sun had gone down.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he spent the night there because the sun had gone down.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> He took one of the stones</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he took from the stones of the place,” which here means Jacob took one of the stones (see v. 18).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and placed it near his head.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he put [it at] the place of his head.” The text does not actually say the stone was placed under his head to serve as a pillow, although most interpreters and translators assume this. It is possible the stone served some other purpose. Jacob does not seem to have been a committed monotheist yet (see v. 20-21) so he may have believed it contained some spiritual power. Note that later in the story he anticipates the stone becoming the residence of God (see v. 22). Many cultures throughout the world view certain types of stones as magical and/or sacred. See J. G. Fraser, Folklore in the Old Testament, 231-37.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Then he fell asleep</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “lay down.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in that place </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="GEN.28.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> and had a dream.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and dreamed.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> He saw</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and look.” The scene which Jacob witnessed is described in three clauses introduced with הִנֵּה (hinneh). In this way the narrator invites the reader to witness the scene through Jacob’s eyes. J. P. Fokkelman points out that the particle goes with a lifted arm and an open mouth: “There, a ladder! Oh, angels! and look, the Lord himself” (Narrative Art in Genesis [SSN], 51-52).</span></span></span><span class="content"> a stairway</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew noun סֻלָּם (sullam, “ladder, stairway”) occurs only here in the OT, but there appears to be an Akkadian cognate simmiltu (with metathesis of the second and third consonants and a feminine ending) which has a specialized meaning of “stairway, ramp.” See H. R. Cohen, Biblical Hapax Legomena (SBLDS), 34. For further discussion see C. Houtman, “What Did Jacob See in His Dream at Bethel? Some Remarks on Genesis 28:10-22,” VT 27 (1977): 337-52; J. G. Griffiths, “The Celestial Ladder and the Gate of Heaven,” ExpTim 76 (1964/65): 229-30; and A. R.

(The Niphal of “bless” is only used in formulations of the Abrahamic covenant. See Gen 12:2; 18:18; 28:14.) Traditionally the verb is taken as passive here, as if Jacob were going to be a channel or source of blessing. But in other formulations of the Abrahamic covenant (see Gen 22:18; 26:4) the Hitpael replaces this Niphal form, suggesting a translation “will bless (i.e., pronounce blessings upon) themselves/one another.” The Hitpael of “bless” is used with a reflexive/reciprocal sense in Deut 29:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 65:16; Jer 4:2. Gen 28:14 predicts that Jacob will be held up as a paradigm of divine blessing and that people will use his name in their blessing formulae (see Gen 12:2 and 18:18 as well, where Abram/Abraham receives this promise). For examples of blessing formulae utilizing an individual as an example of blessing see Gen 48:20 and Ruth 4:11.</span></span></span><span class="content"> using your name and that of your descendants.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and they will pronounce blessings by you, all the families of the earth, and by your offspring.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="GEN.28.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> I am with you!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Look, I [am] with you.” The clause is a nominal clause; the verb to be supplied could be present (as in the translation) or future, “Look, I [will be] with you” (cf.

Since the top of the stairway reached the heavens where the Lord stood, Jacob poured oil on the top of the stone. See C. F.
