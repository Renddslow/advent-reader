This third category develops from the second by metonymy. In certain contexts emotional pain leads to embarrassment and/or anger. In this last use the subject sometimes directs his anger against the source of grief (see especially Gen 6:6). The third category fits best in Gen 34:7 because Jacob’s sons were not merely wounded emotionally. On the contrary, Shechem’s action prompted them to strike out in judgment against the source of their distress.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and very angry because Shechem</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent (Shechem) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> had disgraced Israel</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a disgraceful thing he did against Israel.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> by sexually assaulting</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “by lying with the daughter of Jacob.” The infinitive here explains the preceding verb, indicating exactly how he had disgraced Jacob. The expression “to lie with” is a euphemism for sexual relations, or in this case, sexual assault.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Jacob’s daughter, a crime that should not be committed.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and so it should not be done.” The negated imperfect has an obligatory nuance here, but there is also a generalizing tone. The narrator emphasizes that this particular type of crime (sexual assault) is especially reprehensible.</span></span></span></span></div>

This is a slightly different way of saying what was reported earlier (v. 3). However, there is no mention here of the offense. Even though Hamor is speaking to Dinah’s brothers, he refers to her as their daughter (see v. 17).</span></span></span><span class="content"> Please give her to him as his wife. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="GEN.34.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content"> Intermarry with us.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “form marriage alliances with us.”sn Intermarry with us.
