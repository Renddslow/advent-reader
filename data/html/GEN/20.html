It is a highly rhetorical expression.</span></span></span><span class="content"> because of the woman you have taken, for she is someone else’s wife.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and she is owned by an owner.” The disjunctive clause is causal or explanatory in this case.</span></span></span></span></div>

Some, finding the reference to a nation problematic, prefer to emend the text and read, “Would you really kill someone who is innocent?” See E. A. Speiser, Genesis (AB), 149.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="GEN.20.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Did Abraham</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he”; the referent has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> not say to me, ‘She is my sister’?

Abraham was known as a man of God whose prayer would be effectual. Ironically and sadly, he was also known as a liar.</span></span></span><span class="content"> But if you don’t give her back,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “if there is not you returning.” The suffix on the particle becomes the subject of the negated clause.</span></span></span><span class="content"> know that you will surely die</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The imperfect is preceded by the infinitive absolute to make the warning emphatic.</span></span></span><span class="content"> along with all who belong to you.”</span></span></div>

For discussion of the cultural background of the passage, see J. J. Rabinowitz, “The Great Sin in Ancient Egyptian Marriage Contracts,” JNES 18 (1959): 73, and W. L. Moran, “The Scandal of the ‘Great Sin’ at Ugarit,” JNES 18 (1959): 280-81.</span></span></span><span class="content"> You have done things to me that should not be done!”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Deeds which should not be done you have done to me.” The imperfect has an obligatory nuance here.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="GEN.20.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Then Abimelech asked</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “And Abimelech said to.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Abraham, “What prompted you to do this thing?”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “What did you see that you did this thing?” The question implies that Abraham had some motive for deceiving Abimelech.</span></span></span></span></div>

This may be a case of grammatical agreement with the name for God, which is plural in form. However, when this plural name refers to the one true God, accompanying predicates are usually singular in form. Perhaps Abraham is accommodating his speech to Abimelech’s polytheistic perspective. (See GKC 463 §145.i.) If so, one should translate, “when the gods made me wander.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> from my father’s house, I told her, ‘This is what you can do to show your loyalty to me:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “This is your loyal deed which you can do for me.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Every place we go, say about me, “He is my brother.”’”</span></span></div>

He also gave his wife Sarah back to him. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="GEN.20.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> Then Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you; live wherever you please.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “In the [place that is] good in your eyes live!”</span></span></span></span></div>

The standards for weighing money varied considerably in the ancient Near East, but the generally accepted weight for the shekel is 11.5 grams (0.4 ounce). This makes the weight of silver here 11.5 kilograms, or 400 ounces (about 25 pounds).</span></span></span><span class="content"> to your ‘brother.’</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn To your ‘brother.’ Note the way that the king refers to Abraham. Was he being sarcastic? It was surely a rebuke to Sarah. What is amazing is how patient this king was. It is proof that the fear of God was in that place, contrary to what Abraham believed (see v. 11).</span></span></span><span class="content"> This is compensation for you so that you will stand vindicated before all who are with you.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Look, it is for you a covering of the eyes, for all who are with you, and with all, and you are set right.” The exact meaning of the statement is unclear. Apparently it means that the gift of money somehow exonerates her in other people’s eyes. They will not look on her as compromised (see G. J. Wenham, Genesis [WBC], 2:74).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="GEN.20.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, as well as his wife and female slaves so that they were able to have children. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="GEN.20.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> For the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn In the Hebrew text the clause begins with “because.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> had caused infertility to strike every woman</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb had completely closed up every womb.” In the Hebrew text infinitive absolute precedes the finite verb for emphasis.sn The Lord had closed up every womb. This fact indicates that Sarah was in Abimelech’s household for weeks or months before the dream revelation was given (20:6-7). No one in his household could have children after Sarah arrived on the scene.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the household of Abimelech because he took</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “because of.” The words “he took” are supplied in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</span></span></div>
