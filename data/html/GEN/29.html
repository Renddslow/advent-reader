To be one’s “bone and flesh” is to be someone’s blood relative. For example, the phrase describes the relationship between Abimelech and the Shechemites (Judg 9:2; his mother was a Shechemite); David and the Israelites (2 Sam 5:1); David and the elders of Judah (2 Sam 19:12,); and David and his nephew Amasa (2 Sam 19:13, see 2 Sam 17:2; 1 Chr 2:16-17).</span></span></span><span class="content"> So Jacob</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he”; the referent (Jacob) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> stayed with him for a month.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a month of days.”</span></span></span></span></div>
