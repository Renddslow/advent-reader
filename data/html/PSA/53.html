         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 53</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 53. This psalm is very similar to Ps 14. The major difference comes in v. 5, which corresponds to, but differs quite a bit from, Ps 14:5-6, and in the use of the divine name. Ps 14 uses “the Lord” (יְהוָה, yÿhvah, “Yahweh”) in vv. 2a, 4, 6, and 7, while Ps 53 employs “God” (אֱלֹהִים, ’elohim) throughout, as one might expect in Pss 42-83, where the name “Yahweh” is relatively infrequent. The psalmist observes that the human race is morally corrupt. Evildoers oppress God’s people, but the psalmist is confident of God’s protection and anticipates a day when God will vindicate Israel.</span></span></span></span></div>

This statement is probably not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that he is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see Ps 10:4, 11).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.53.1"><span class="content">They sin and commit evil deeds;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “they act corruptly, they do evil [with] injustice.” Ps 14:1 has עֲלִילָה (’alilah, “a deed”) instead of עָוֶל (’aval, “injustice”). The verbs describe the typical behavior of the wicked. The subject of the plural verbs is “sons of man” (v. 2). The entire human race is characterized by sinful behavior. This practical atheism – living as if there is no God who will hold them accountable for their actions – makes them fools, for one of the earmarks of folly is to fail to anticipate the long range consequences of one’s behavior.</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.53.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> They are absolutely terrified,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “there they are afraid [with] fear.” The perfect verbal form is probably used in a rhetorical manner; the psalmist describes the future demise of the oppressors as if it were already occurring. The adverb שָׁם (sham, “there”) is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (BDB 1027 s.v.). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror (“absolutely”).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.53.5"><span class="content">even by things that do not normally cause fear.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “there is no fear.” Apparently this means the evildoers are so traumatized with panic (see v. 5b) that they now jump with fear at everything, even those things that would not normally cause fear. Ps 14:5 omits this line.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.53.5"><span class="content">For God annihilates</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “scatters the bones.” The perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. Scattering the bones alludes to the aftermath of a battle. God annihilates his enemies, leaving their carcasses spread all over the battlefield. As the bodies are devoured by wild animals and decay, the bones of God’s dead enemies are exposed. See Ps 141:7.</span></span></span><span class="content"> those who attack you.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “[those who] encamp [against] you.” The second person masculine singular pronominal suffix probably refers to God’s people viewed as a collective whole. Instead of “for God scatters the bones of those who encamp against you,” Ps 14:5 reads, “for God is with a godly generation.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.53.5"><span class="content">You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Once again the perfect is used in a rhetorical manner, describing this future judgment as if it were already accomplished. As in the previous line, God’s people are probably addressed. The second person singular verb form is apparently collective, suggesting that the people are viewed here as a unified whole. Ps 14:6 reads here “the counsel of the oppressed you put to shame, even though God is his shelter,” the words being addressed to the wicked.</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.53.6"><span class="content">may Jacob rejoice,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb form is jussive.</span></span></span></span></div>
