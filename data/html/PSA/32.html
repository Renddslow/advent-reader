         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 32</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 32. The psalmist recalls the agony he experienced prior to confessing his sins and affirms that true happiness comes when one’s sins are forgiven. He then urges others not to be stubborn, but to turn to God while forgiveness is available, for God extends his mercy to the repentant, while the wicked experience nothing but sorrow.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">By David; a well-written song.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn The meaning of the Hebrew term מַשְׂכִּיל (maskil) is uncertain. The word is derived from a verb meaning “to be prudent; to be wise.” Various options are: “a contemplative song,” “a song imparting moral wisdom,” or “a skillful [i.e., well-written] song.” The term occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142, as well as in Ps 47:7.</span></span></span></span></div>

The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).

The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, the gender and age specific “man” has been translated with the more neutral “one.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> whose wrongdoing the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> does not punish,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “blessed [is] the man to whom the Lord does not impute wrongdoing.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The point is not that the individual is sinless and pure. In this context, which focuses on confession and forgiveness of sin, the psalmist refers to one who refuses to deny or hide his sin, but instead honestly confesses it to God.</span></span></span></span></div>

A noun לָשָׁד (lashad, “cake”) is attested in Num 11:8, but it would make no sense to understand that word in this context. It is better to emend the form to לְשֻׁדִּי (lÿshuddiy, “to my destruction”) and understand “your hand” as the subject of the verb “was turned.” In this case the text reads, “[your hand] was turned to my destruction.” In Lam 3:3 the author laments that God’s “hand” was “turned” (הָפַךְ, hafakh) against him in a hostile sense.sn You tried to destroy me. The psalmist’s statement reflects his perspective. As far as he was concerned, it seemed as if the Lord was trying to kill him.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the intense heat</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The translation assumes that the plural form indicates degree.

Perhaps the psalmist suffered during the hot season and perceived the very weather as being an instrument of divine judgment. Another option is that he compares his time of suffering to the uncomfortable and oppressive heat of summer.</span></span></span><span class="content"> (Selah)</span></span></div>

The psalmist addresses each member of his audience individually (see also the note on the word “eye” in the next line).

NASB “I will instruct you and teach you…I will counsel you with My eye upon you”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> about how you should live.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “I will instruct you and I will teach you in the way [in] which you should walk.”</span></span></span></span></div>

Here the expression “my eye upon you” may simply mean that the psalmist will teach his pupils directly and personally.</span></span></span></span></div>

Normally the word refers to “jewelry,” so some suggest the meaning “trappings” here (cf. NASB). Some emend the form to לְחֵיהֶם (lÿkhehem, “their jawbones”) but it is difficult to see how the present Hebrew text, even if corrupt, could have derived from this proposed original reading. P. C. Craigie (Psalms 1-50 [WBC], 265) takes the form from an Arabic root and translates “whose gallop.” Cf. also NRSV “whose temper must be curbed.”</span></span></span></span></div>
