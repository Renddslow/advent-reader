NEB, NASB, NRSV) or as a substantival adjective “evil one” (the references to evil people in the next two verses favor this; cf.

Instead it refers more specifically to a slanderous and/or deceitful statement that promotes one’s own selfish, sinful interests and/or exploits or harms those who are innocent. Note the emphasis on violence and deceit in the following line.</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="PSA.5.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> But as for me,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn But as for me. By placing the first person pronoun at the beginning of the verse, the psalmist highlights the contrast between the evildoers’ actions and destiny, outlined in the preceding verses, with his own.</span></span></span><span class="content"> because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn I will enter your house. The psalmist is confident that God will accept him into his presence, in contrast to the evildoers (see v. 5).</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.5.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">  </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, lead me in your righteousness</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn God’s providential leading is in view. His צְדָקָה (tsÿdaqah, “righteousness”) includes here the deliverance that originates in his righteousness; he protects and vindicates the one whose cause is just. For other examples of this use of the word, see BDB 842 s.v.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.5.8"><span class="content">because of those who wait to ambush me,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “because of those who watch me [with evil intent].” See also Pss 27:11; 56:2.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.5.8"><span class="content">remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “make level before me your way.” The imperative “make level” is Hiphil in the Kethib (consonantal text); Piel in the Qere (marginal reading). God’s “way” is here the way in which he leads the psalmist providentially (see the preceding line, where the psalmist asks the Lord to lead him).</span></span></span></span></div>

The singular is collective or representative, as the plural in the next line indicates, and so has been translated “they.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="PSA.5.9"><span class="content">their stomachs are like the place of destruction,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “their inward part[s] [is] destruction.” For a discussion of the extended metaphor in v. 9b, see the note on the word “it” at the end of the verse.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="PSA.5.9"><span class="content">their throats like an open grave,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “their throat is an open grave.” For a discussion of the extended metaphor in v. 9b, see the note on the word “it” at the end of the verse. The metaphor is suggested by the physical resemblance of the human throat to a deeply dug grave; both are dark chasms.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="PSA.5.9"><span class="content">their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “they make smooth their tongue.” Flattering, deceitful words are in view. See Ps 12:2. The psalmist’s deceitful enemies are compared to the realm of death/Sheol in v. 9b. Sheol was envisioned as a dark region within the earth, the entrance to which was the grave with its steep slopes (cf. Ps 88:4-6). The enemies’ victims are pictured here as slipping down a steep slope (the enemies’ tongues) and falling into an open grave (their throat) that terminates in destruction in the inner recesses of Sheol (their stomach). The enemies’ קרב (“inward part”) refers here to their thoughts and motives, which are destructive in their intent. The throat is where these destructive thoughts are transformed into words, and their tongue is what they use to speak the deceitful words that lead their innocent victims to their demise.sn As the psalmist walks down the path in which God leads him, he asks the Lord to guide his steps and remove danger from the path (v. 8), because he knows his enemies have “dug a grave” for him and are ready to use their deceitful words to “swallow him up” like the realm of death (i.e., Sheol) and bring him to ruin.</span></span></span></span></div>

The psalmist calls judgment down on the evildoers. Their plans will be their downfall in that God will judge them for their evil schemes.</span></span></span></span></div>

Seeking his protection presupposes and even demonstrates the subject’s loyalty to the Lord. In the psalms those who “take shelter” in the Lord are contrasted with the wicked and equated with those who love, fear and serve the Lord (Pss 5:11-12; 31:17-20; 34:21-22).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in you be happy!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The prefixed verbal form is a jussive of wish or prayer.

The imperfect expresses the psalmist’s wish or request.</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that those who are loyal to you</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the lovers of your name.” The phrase refers to those who are loyal to the Lord.
