In this wisdom psalm the author advises his audience to reject the lifestyle of the wicked and to be loyal to God. The psalmist contrasts the destiny of the wicked with that of the righteous, emphasizing that the wicked are eventually destroyed while the godly prosper under the Lord’s protective care.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.1.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> How blessed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew noun is an abstract plural. The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see v. 3; Pss 2:12; 34:9; 41:1; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).</span></span></span><span class="content"> is the one</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “[Oh] the happiness [of] the man.” Hebrew wisdom literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender and age specific “man” with the more neutral “one.” (Generic “he” is employed in vv. 2-3). Since the godly man described in the psalm is representative of followers of God (note the plural form צַדִּיקִים [tsadiqim, “righteous, godly”] in vv. 5-6), one could translate the collective singular with the plural “those” both here and in vv. 2-3, where singular pronouns and verbal forms are utilized in the Hebrew text (cf. NRSV). However, here the singular form may emphasize that godly individuals are usually outnumbered by the wicked. Retaining the singular allows the translation to retain this emphasis.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who does not follow</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “walk in.” The three perfect verbal forms in v. 1 refer in this context to characteristic behavior. The sequence “walk–stand–sit” envisions a progression from relatively casual association with the wicked to complete identification with them.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the advice</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew noun translated “advice” most often refers to the “counsel” or “advice” one receives from others. To “walk in the advice of the wicked” means to allow their evil advice to impact and determine one’s behavior.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the wicked,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn In the psalms the Hebrew term רְשָׁעִים (rÿsha’im, “wicked”) describes people who are proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God’s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps 37:21).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.1.1"><span class="content">or stand in the pathway</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn “Pathway” here refers to the lifestyle of sinners. To “stand in the pathway of/with sinners” means to closely associate with them in their sinful behavior.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with sinners,</span></span></div>

NEB, NIV), appears to refer to the whole assembly of evildoers. The word also carries the semantic nuance “assembly” in Ps 107:32, where it is in synonymous parallelism with קָהָל (qahal, “assembly”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> of scoffers!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew word refers to arrogant individuals (Prov 21:24) who love conflict (Prov 22:10) and vociferously reject wisdom and correction (Prov 1:22; 9:7-8; 13:1; 15:12). To “sit in the assembly” of such people means to completely identify with them in their proud, sinful plans and behavior.</span></span></span></span></div>

Study of the law is metonymic here for the correct attitudes and behavior that should result from an awareness of and commitment to God’s moral will; thus “obeying” has been used in the translation rather than “studying.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.1.2"><span class="content">he meditates on</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew imperfect verbal form draws attention to the characteristic behavior described here and lends support to the hyperbolic adverbial phrase “day and night.” The verb הָגָה (hagag) means “to recite quietly; to meditate” and refers metonymically to intense study and reflection.</span></span></span><span class="content"> his commands</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “his law.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> day and night.</span></span></div>

According to the psalmist, the one who studies and obeys God’s commands typically prospers.</span></span></span><span class="content"> a tree planted by flowing streams;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “channels of water.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The simile suggests that the godly have a continual source of life which in turn produces stability and uninterrupted prosperity.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.1.3"><span class="content">He succeeds in everything he attempts.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and all which he does prospers”; or “and all which he does he causes to prosper.” (The simile of the tree does not extend to this line.) It is not certain if the Hiphil verbal form (יַצְלִיחַ, yatsliakh) is intransitive-exhibitive (“prospers”) or causative (“causes to prosper”) here. If the verb is intransitive, then כֹּל (kol, “all, everything”) is the subject. If the verb is causative, then the godly individual or the Lord himself is the subject and כֹּל is the object. The wording is reminiscent of Josh 1:8, where the Lord tells Joshua: “This law scroll must not leave your lips! You must memorize it day and night so you can carefully obey all that is written in it. Then you will prosper (literally, “cause your way to prosper”) and be successful.”</span></span></span></span></div>

In contrast to the well-rooted and productive tree described in v. 3, the wicked are like a dried up plant that has no root system and is blown away by the wind. The simile describes the destiny of the wicked (see vv. 5-6).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.1.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> For this reason</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “Therefore.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the wicked cannot withstand</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “arise in,” but the verb is used metonymically here in the sense of “stand”; “endure,” as in 1 Sam 13:14 and Job 8:15. The negated Hebrew imperfect verbal form is here taken as indicating incapability or lack of potential, though one could understand the verb form as indicating what is typical (“do not withstand”) or what will happen (“will not withstand”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> judgment,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the judgment.” The article indicates a judgment that is definite in the mind of the speaker. In the immediate context this probably does not refer to the “final judgment” described in later biblical revelation, but to a temporal/historical judgment which the author anticipates. Periodically during the OT period, God would come in judgment, removing the wicked from the scene, while preserving a godly remnant (see Gen 6-9; Ps 37; Hab 3).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.1.5"><span class="content">nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and sinners in the assembly (or “circle”) of [the] godly.” The negative particle and verb from the preceding line are assumed by ellipsis here (“will not arise/stand”).sn The assembly of the godly is insulated from divine judgment (Ps 37:12-17, 28-29).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.1.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Certainly</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The translation understands כי as asseverative. Another option is to translate “for,” understanding v. 6 as a theological explanation for vv. 3-5, which contrasts the respective destinies of the godly and the wicked.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> guards the way of the godly,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the Lord knows the way of the righteous.” To “know a way” means, in its most basic sense, “to recognize/acknowledge a pathway, route, or prescribed way of life” (see Josh 3:4; Job 21:14; Ps 67:2; Isa 42:16; Jer 5:4-5). Here it could refer to the Lord recognizing the behavior of the godly and, by metonymy, rewarding their godliness with security and prosperity (resulting in the translation, “the Lord rewards the behavior of the godly”). The present translation takes the verb in the sense of “mark out” (cf. Job 23:10), which metonymically could mean “watch over, protect, guard.” In this case the “way of the godly” is not their behavior, but their course of life or destiny; a translation reflecting this would be “the Lord protects the lives of the godly” or “the Lord watches over the destiny of the godly” (cf. NEB, NIV, NRSV). The Hebrew active participle יוֹדֵעַ (yodea’, “knows”) has here a characteristic durative force.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.1.6"><span class="content">but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “but the way of the wicked perishes.” The “way of the wicked” may refer to their course of life (Ps 146:9; Prov 4:19; Jer 12:1) or their sinful behavior (Prov 12:26; 15:9). The Hebrew imperfect verbal form probably describes here what typically happens, though one could take the form as indicating what will happen (“will perish”).</span></span></span></span></div>
