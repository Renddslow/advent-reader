         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 108</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 108. With some minor variations, this psalm is a composite of Ps 57:7-11 (see vv. 1-5) and Ps 60:5-12 (see vv. 6-13).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">A song, a psalm of David.</span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.108.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> I am determined,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or perhaps “confident”; Heb “my heart is steadfast.” The “heart” is viewed here as the seat of the psalmist’s volition and/or emotions.</span></span></span><span class="content"> O God!</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.108.1"><span class="content">I will sing and praise you with my whole heart.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “also my glory,” but this makes little sense in the context. Some view the term כָּבוֹד (“glory”) here as a metonymy for man’s inner being (see BDB 459 s.v. II כָּבוֹד 5), but it is preferable to emend the form to כְּבֵדִי (kÿvodiy, “my liver”). Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one’s emotions. See also Pss 16:9; 30:12; 57:9; as well as H. W. Wolff, Anthropology of the Old Testament, 64, and M. Dahood, Psalms (AB), 3:93. For an Ugaritic example of the heart/liver as the source of joy, see G. R. Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, 47-48: “her [Anat’s] liver swelled with laughter, her heart was filled with joy, the liver of Anat with triumph.”</span></span></span></span></div>

When salvation “dawns,” the psalmist will “wake up” in praise.</span></span></span></span></div>
