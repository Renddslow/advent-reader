         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 9</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 9. The psalmist, probably speaking on behalf of Israel or Judah, praises God for delivering him from hostile nations. He celebrates God’s sovereignty and justice, and calls on others to join him in boasting of God’s greatness. Many Hebrew mss and the ancient Greek version (LXX) combine Psalms 9 and 10 into a single psalm.</span></span></span></span></div>

Some mss divide the form into עַל מוּת (’al mut, “according to the death [of the son]”), while the LXX assumes a reading עֲלֻמוֹת עַל (’al ’alumot, “according to alumoth”). The phrase probably refers to a particular tune or musical style.</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> a psalm of David.</span></div>

See especially Ps 47:2.</span></span></span></span></div>

Another option is to understand the verbs as describing what is typical (“you defend…you sit on a throne”).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.9.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> You terrified the nations with your battle cry;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb גָּעַר (ga’ar) is often understood to mean “rebuke” and in this context taken to refer to the Lord’s “rebuke” of the nations. In some cases it is apparent that scolding or threatening is in view (see Gen 37:10; Ruth 2:16; Zech 3:2). However, in militaristic contexts this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior’s battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See A. Caquot, TDOT 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Pss 68:30; 106:9; and Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 18:15; 76:6; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.</span></span></span></span></div>

In the psalms the “wicked” (רְשָׁעִים, rÿsha’im) are typically proud, practical atheists (Ps 10:2, 4, 11) who hate God’s commands, commit sinful deeds, speak lies and slander (Ps 50:16-20), and cheat others (Ps 37:21). In this context the hostile nations who threaten Israel/Judah are in view.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.9.5"><span class="content">you permanently wiped out all memory of them.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “their name you wiped out forever and ever.” The three perfect verbal forms in v. 5 probably refer to a recent victory (definite past or present perfect use), although they might express what is typical (characteristic use).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.9.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> The enemy’s cities have been reduced to permanent ruins;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the enemy – they have come to an end [in] ruins permanently.” The singular form אוֹיֵב (’oyev, “enemy”) is collective. It is placed at the beginning of the verse to heighten the contrast with יְהוָה (yÿhvah, “the Lord”) in v. 7.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.9.6"><span class="content">you destroyed their cities;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “you uprooted cities.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The referent of the masculine pronoun is the nations/enemies (cf. v. 5), not the cities (the Hebrew noun עָרִים [’arim, “cities”] is grammatically feminine). This has been specified in the present translation for clarity; many modern translations retain the pronoun “them,” resulting in ambiguity (cf. NRSV “their cities you have rooted out; the very memory of them has perished”).</span></span></span></span></div>

NEB “tower of strength”; NIV, NRSV “stronghold”).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="PSA.9.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Your loyal followers trust in you,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and the ones who know your name trust in you.” The construction vav (ו) conjunctive + imperfect at the beginning of the verse expresses another consequence of the statement made in v. 8. “To know” the Lord’s “name” means to be his follower, recognizing his authority and maintaining loyalty to him. See Ps 91:14, where “knowing” the Lord’s “name” is associated with loving him.</span></span></span></span></div>
