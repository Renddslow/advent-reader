         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 3</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 3. The psalmist acknowledges that he is confronted by many enemies (vv. 1-2). But, alluding to a divine oracle he has received (vv. 4-5), he affirms his confidence in God’s ability to protect him (vv. 3, 6) and requests that God make his promise a reality (vv. 7-8).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">A psalm of David, written when he fled from his son Absalom.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn According to Jewish tradition, David offered this prayer when he was forced to flee from Jerusalem during his son Absalom’s attempted coup (see 2 Sam 15:13-17).</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.3.3"><span class="content">you are my glory</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my glory,” or “my honor.” The psalmist affirms that the Lord is his source of honor, i.e., the one who gives him honor in the sight of others. According to BDB 459 s.v. II כָּבוֹד 7, the phrase refers to God as the one to whom the psalmist gives honor. But the immediate context focuses on what God does for the psalmist, not vice-versa.</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the one who restores me.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “[the one who] lifts my head.” This phrase could be understood to refer to a general strengthening of the psalmist by God during difficult circumstances. However, if one takes the suggestion of the superscription that this is a Davidic psalm written during the revolt of Absalom, the phrase “lift the head” could refer to the psalmist’s desire for restoration to his former position (cf. Gen 40:13 where the same phrase is used). Like the Hebrew text, the present translation (“who restores me”) can be understood in either sense.</span></span></span></span></div>

Consequently the verb form in v. 4a is better understood as a preterite, “I cried out.” (For another example of the preterite of this same verb form, see Ps 30:8.) Sometime after the crisis arose, the psalmist prayed to the Lord and received an assuring answer. Now he confidently awaits the fulfillment of the divine promise.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.3.4"><span class="content">and he answered me from his holy hill.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn His holy hill. That is, Zion (see Pss 2:6; 48:1-2). The psalmist recognizes that the Lord dwells in his sanctuary on Mount Zion.</span></span></span><span class="content"> (Selah)</span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.3.5"><span class="content">I awoke,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The three verbal forms that appear in succession here (perfect + vav [ו] consecutive with preterite + perfect) are most naturally taken as narrational. When the psalmist received an assuring word from the Lord, he was able to sleep calmly. Because the Lord was protecting him, he awoke safely from his sleep.</span></span></span><span class="content"> for the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> protects</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “supports”; “sustains.” In this explanatory causal clause the imperfect verbal form probably has a habitual or present progressive nuance, for the psalmist is confident of God’s continual protection (see v. 3). Another option is to take the verb as a preterite, “for the Lord protected me.” In this case, the psalmist focuses specifically on the protection God provided while he slept.</span></span></span><span class="content"> me.</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.3.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> I am not afraid</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The imperfect verbal form here expresses the psalmist’s continuing attitude as he faces the crisis at hand.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the multitude of people</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or perhaps “troops.” The Hebrew noun עָם (’am) sometimes refers to a military contingent or army.</span></span></span></span></div>

Now, using the same verbal root (קוּם, qum) he asks the Lord to rise up (קוּמָה, qumah) in his defense.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">!</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="PSA.3.7"><span class="content">Deliver me, my God!</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="PSA.3.7"><span class="content">Yes,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Elsewhere in the psalms the particle כִּי (ki), when collocated with a perfect verbal form and subordinated to a preceding imperative directed to God, almost always has an explanatory or causal force (“for, because”) and introduces a motivating argument for why God should respond positively to the request (see Pss 5:10; 6:2; 12:1; 16:1; 41:4; 55:9; 56:1; 57:1; 60:2; 69:1; 74:20; 119:94; 123:3; 142:6; 143:8). (On three occasions the כִּי is recitative after a verb of perception [“see/know that,” see Pss 4:3; 25:19; 119:159]). If כִּי is taken as explanatory here, then the psalmist is arguing that God should deliver him now because that is what God characteristically does. However, such a motivating argument is not used in the passages cited above. The motivating argument usually focuses on the nature of the psalmist’s dilemma or the fact that he trusts in the Lord. For this reason it is unlikely that כִּי has its normal force here. Most scholars understand the particle כִּי as having an asseverative (emphasizing) function here (“indeed, yes”; NEB leaves the particle untranslated).</span></span></span><span class="content"> you will strike</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn If the particle כִּי (ki) is taken as explanatory, then the perfect verbal forms in v. 7b would describe God’s characteristic behavior. However, as pointed out in the preceding note on the word “yes,” the particle probably has an asseverative force here. If so, the perfects may be taken as indicating rhetorically the psalmist’s certitude and confidence that God will intervene. The psalmist is so confident of God’s positive response to his prayer, he can describe God’s assault on his enemies as if it had already happened. Such confidence is consistent with the mood of the psalm, as expressed before (vv. 3-6) and after this (v. 8). Another option is to take the perfects as precative, expressing a wish or request (“Strike all my enemies on the jaw, break the teeth of the wicked”). See IBHS 494-95 §30.5.4c, d. However, not all grammarians are convinced that the perfect is used as a precative in biblical Hebrew.</span></span></span><span class="content"> all my enemies on the jaw;</span></span></div>

They oppose God and his people.</span></span></span></span></div>
