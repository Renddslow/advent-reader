         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 52</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 52. The psalmist confidently confronts his enemy and affirms that God will destroy evildoers and vindicate the godly.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">For the music director; a well-written song</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn The meaning of the Hebrew term מַשְׂכִּיל (maskil) is uncertain. The word is derived from a verb meaning “to be prudent; to be wise.” Various options are: “a contemplative song,” “a song imparting moral wisdom,” or “a skillful [i.e., well-written] song.” The term occurs in the superscriptions of Pss 32, 42, 44, 45, 52-55, 74, 78, 88, 89, and 142, as well as in Ps 47:7.</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> by David. It was written when Doeg the Edomite went and informed Saul: “David has arrived at the home of Ahimelech.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn Heb “when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul and said to him, ‘David has come to the house of Ahimelech.’”sn According to the superscription, David wrote this psalm during the period when Saul was seeking his life. On one occasion Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s head shepherd (1 Sam 21:7), informed Saul of David’s whereabouts (see 1 Sam 21-22).</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.52.1"><span class="content">God’s loyal love protects me all day long!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the loyal love of God [is] all the day.” In this context, where the psalmist is threatened by his enemy, the point seems to be that the psalmist is protected by God’s loyal love at all times.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.52.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Your tongue carries out your destructive plans;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “destruction your tongue devises.”</span></span></span></span></div>

HALOT 135 s.v. III *בֶּלַע proposes a homonym here, meaning “confusion.” This would fit the immediate context nicely and provide a close parallel to the following line, which refers to deceptive words.</span></span></span></span></div>

The verb (derived from the root עָזַז, ’azaz, “be strong”) as it stands is either an imperfect (if so, probably used in a customary sense) or a preterite (without vav [ו] consecutive). However the form should probably be emended to וַיָּעָז (vayya’az), a Qal preterite (with vav [ו] consecutive) from עָזַז. Note the preterite form without vav (ו) consecutive in the preceding line (וַיִּבְטַח, vayyivtakh, “and he trusted”). The prefixed vav (ו) was likely omitted by haplography (note the suffixed vav [ו] on the preceding עָשְׁרוֹ, ’oshro, “his wealth”).</span></span></span></span></div>
