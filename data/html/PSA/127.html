In this wisdom psalm the psalmist teaches that one does not find security by one’s own efforts, for God alone gives stability and security.</span></span></span></span></div>

Perhaps worshipers recited these psalms when they ascended the road to Jerusalem to celebrate annual religious festivals. For a discussion of their background see L. C. Allen, Psalms 101-150 (WBC), 219-21.</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> by Solomon.</span></div>

It may refer on the surface level to a literal physical structure in which a family lives, but at a deeper, metaphorical level it refers to building, perpetuating, and maintaining a family line. See Deut 25:9; Ruth 4:11; 1 Sam 2:35; 2 Sam 7:27; 1 Kgs 11:38; 1 Chr 17:10, 25. Having a family line provided security in ancient Israel.</span></span></span></span></div>

See לָכֶם (lakhem, “for you”).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.127.2"><span class="content">Yes,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Here the Hebrew particle כֵּן (ken) is used to stress the following affirmation (see Josh 2:4; Ps 63:2).</span></span></span><span class="content"> he can provide for those whom he loves even when they sleep.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he gives to his beloved, sleep.” The translation assumes that the Hebrew term שֵׁנָא (shena’, “sleep,” an alternate form of שֵׁנָה, shenah) is an adverbial accusative. The point seems to be this: Hard work by itself is not what counts, but one’s relationship to God, for God is able to bless an individual even while he sleeps. (There may even be a subtle allusion to the miracle of conception following sexual intercourse; see the reference to the gift of sons in the following verse.) The statement is not advocating laziness, but utilizing hyperbole to give perspective and to remind the addressees that God must be one’s first priority. Another option is to take “sleep” as the direct object: “yes, he gives sleep to his beloved” (cf. NIV, NRSV). In this case the point is this: Hard work by itself is futile, for only God is able to bless one with sleep, which metonymically refers to having one’s needs met. He blesses on the basis of one’s relationship to him, not on the basis of physical energy expended.</span></span></span></span></div>

Daughters are certainly wonderful additions to a family, but in ancient Israelite culture sons were the “arrows” that gave a man security in his old age, for they could defend the family interests at the city gate, where the legal and economic issues of the community were settled.</span></span></span><span class="content"> are a gift from the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">,</span></span></div>

The phrase “sons of youth” is elliptical, meaning “sons [born during the father’s] youth.” Such sons will have grown up to be mature adults and will have children of their own by the time the father reaches old age and becomes vulnerable to enemies. Contrast the phrase “son of old age” in Gen 37:3 (see also 44:20), which refers to Jacob’s age when Joseph was born.</span></span></span></span></div>

One could be humiliated (Ps 69:12) or deprived of justice (Amos 5:12) at the gate, but with strong sons to defend the family interests this was less likely to happen.</span></span></span><span class="content"> when they confront</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “speak with.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> enemies at the city gate.</span></span></div>
