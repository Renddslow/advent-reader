(see Isa 36-37).</span></span></span><span class="content"> (Selah)</span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.76.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> The bravehearted</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “strong of heart.” In Isa 46:12, the only other text where this phrase appears, it refers to those who are stubborn, but here it seems to describe brave warriors (see the next line).</span></span></span><span class="content"> were plundered;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The verb is a rare Aramaized form of the Hitpolel (see GKC 149 §54.a, n. 2); the root is שָׁלַל (shalal, “to plunder”).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.76.5"><span class="content">they “fell asleep.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “they slept [in] their sleep.” “Sleep” here refers to the “sleep” of death. A number of modern translations take the phrase to refer to something less than death, however: NASB “cast into a deep sleep”; NEB “fall senseless”; NIV “lie still”; NRSV “lay stunned.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.76.5"><span class="content">All the warriors were helpless.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and all the men of strength did not find their hands.”</span></span></span></span></div>

However, in militaristic contexts this translation is inadequate, for the verb refers in this setting to the warrior’s battle cry, which terrifies and paralyzes the enemy. See A. Caquot, TDOT 3:53, and note the use of the verb in Pss 68:30; 106:9; Nah 1:4, as well as the related noun in Job 26:11; Pss 9:5; 18:15; 104:7; Isa 50:2; 51:20; 66:15.</span></span></span><span class="content"> O God of Jacob,</span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.76.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> From heaven you announced what their punishment would be.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a [legal] decision,” or “sentence.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The translation assumes that God’s anger is in view here (see v. 7) and that “men” is an objective genitive. God’s angry judgment against men brings him praise because it reveals his power and majesty (see vv. 1-4).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="PSA.76.10"><span class="content">you reveal your anger in full measure.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the rest of anger you put on.” The meaning of the statement is not entirely clear. Perhaps the idea is that God, as he prepares for battle, girds himself with every last ounce of his anger, as if it were a weapon.</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="PSA.76.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> He humbles princes;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he reduces the spirit of princes.” According to HALOT 148 s.v. II בצר, the Hebrew verb בָּצַר (batsar) is here a hapax legomenon meaning “reduce, humble.” The statement is generalizing, with the imperfect tense highlighting God’s typical behavior.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="PSA.76.12"><span class="content">the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “[he is] awesome to the kings of the earth.”</span></span></span></span></div>
