This psalm describes the character qualities that one must possess to be allowed access to the divine presence.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">A psalm of David.</span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.15.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content">  </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, who may be a guest in your home?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Who may live as a resident alien in your tent?”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.15.1"><span class="content">Who may live on your holy hill?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn In this context the Lord’s holy hill probably refers to Zion/Jerusalem. See Isa 66:20; Joel 2:1; 3:17; Zech 8:3; Pss 2:6; 43:3; 48:1; 87:1; Dan 9:16.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.15.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Whoever lives a blameless life,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “one who walks blamelessly.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.15.2"><span class="content">does what is right,</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.15.2"><span class="content">and speaks honestly.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “one who speaks truth in his heart”; or “one who speaks truth [that is] in his heart.” This apparently refers to formulating a truthful statement in one’s mind and then honestly revealing that statement in one’s speech.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.15.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> He</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Hebrew literature often assumes and reflects the male-oriented perspective of ancient Israelite society. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender or age.</span></span></span><span class="content"> does not slander,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he does not slander upon his tongue.” For another example of רָגַל (ragal, “slander”) see 2 Sam 19:28.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.15.3"><span class="content">or do harm to others,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “his fellow.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.15.3"><span class="content">or insult his neighbor.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and he does not lift up an insult against one who is near to him.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.15.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> He despises a reprobate,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “despised in his eyes [is] a rejected [one].” The Hebrew term נִמְאָס (nim’as, “rejected [one]”) apparently refers here to one who has been rejected by God because of his godless behavior. It stands in contrast to “those who fear God” in the following line.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.15.4"><span class="content">but honors the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s loyal followers.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “those who fear the Lord.” The one who fears the Lord respects his sovereignty and obeys his commandments. See Ps 128:1; Prov 14:2.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.15.4"><span class="content">He makes firm commitments and does not renege on his promise.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he takes an oath to do harm and does not change.” The phrase “to do harm” cannot mean “do harm to others,” for the preceding verse clearly characterizes this individual as one who does not harm others. In this context the phrase must refer to an oath to which a self-imprecation is attached. The godly individual takes his commitments to others so seriously he is willing to “swear to his own hurt.” For an example of such an oath, see Ruth 1:16-17.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.15.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> He does not charge interest when he lends his money.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn He does not charge interest. Such an individual is truly generous, and not simply concerned with making a profit.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.15.5"><span class="content">He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a bribe against the innocent he does not take.” For other texts condemning the practice of a judge or witness taking a bribe, see Exod 23:8; Deut 16:19; 27:25; 1 Sam 8:3; Ezek 22:12; Prov 17:23.</span></span></span></span></div>
