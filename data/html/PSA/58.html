         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 58</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 58. The psalmist calls on God to punish corrupt judges because a vivid display of divine judgment will convince observers that God is the just judge of the world who vindicates the godly.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">For the music director; according to the </span><span class="it"><span class="heading">al-tashcheth</span></span><span class="heading"> style;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn Heb “do not destroy.” Perhaps this refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a musical instrument. These words also appear in the heading to Pss 57, 59, and 75.</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> a prayer</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn The precise meaning of the Hebrew word מִכְתָּם (miktam) which also appears in the heading to Pss 16 and 56-57, 59-60 is uncertain. HALOT 582-83 s.v. defines it as “inscription.”</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> of David.</span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.58.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Really [in] silence, what is right do you speak?” The Hebrew noun אֵלֶם (’elem, “silence”) makes little, if any, sense in this context. Some feel that this is an indictment of the addressees’ failure to promote justice; they are silent when they should make just decisions. The present translation assumes an emendation to אֵלִם (’elim), which in turn is understood as a defectively written form of אֵילִים (’elim, “rulers,” a metaphorical use of אַיִל, ’ayil, “ram”; see Exod 15:15; Ezek 17:13). The rhetorical question is sarcastic, challenging their claim to be just. Elsewhere the collocation of דָּבַר (davar, “speak”) with צֶדֶק (tsedeq, “what is right”) as object means “to speak the truth” (see Ps 52:3; Isa 45:19). Here it refers specifically to declaring what is right in a legal setting, as the next line indicates.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.58.1"><span class="content">Do you judge people</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the sons of mankind.” The translation assumes the phrase is the object of the verb “to judge.” Some take it as a vocative, “Do you judge fairly, O sons of mankind?” (Cf. NASB; see Ezek 20:4; 22:2; 23:36.)</span></span></span><span class="content"> fairly?</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.58.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> No!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The particle אַף (’af, “no”) is used here as a strong adversative emphasizing the following statement, which contrasts reality with the rulers’ claim alluded to in the rhetorical questions (see Ps 44:9).</span></span></span><span class="content"> You plan how to do what is unjust;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in the heart unjust deeds you do.” The phrase “in the heart” (i.e., “mind”) seems to refer to their plans and motives. The Hebrew noun עַוְלָה (’avlah, “injustice”) is collocated with פָּעַל (pa’al, “do”) here and in Job 36:23 and Ps 119:3. Some emend the plural form עוֹלֹת (’olot, “unjust deeds”; see Ps 64:6) to the singular עָוֶל (’avel, “injustice”; see Job 34:32), taking the final tav (ת) as dittographic (note that the following verbal form begins with tav). Some then understand עָוֶל (’avel, “injustice”) as a genitive modifying “heart” and translate, “with a heart of injustice you act.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.58.2"><span class="content">you deal out violence in the earth.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in the earth the violence of your hands you weigh out.” The imagery is from the economic realm. The addressees measure out violence, rather than justice, and distribute it like a commodity. This may be ironic, since justice was sometimes viewed as a measuring scale (see Job 31:6).</span></span></span></span></div>

Another option is to take the form as an imperfect (indicative) and translate, “they will scatter” (see v. 9). The verb מָאַס (ma’as; which is a homonym of the more common מָאַס, “to refuse, reject”) appears only here and in Job 7:5, where it is used of a festering wound from which fluid runs or flows.</span></span></span><span class="content"> like water that flows away!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “like water, they go about for themselves.” The translation assumes that the phrase “they go about for themselves” is an implied relative clause modifying “water.” Another option is to take the clause as independent and parallel to what precedes. In this case the enemies would be the subject and the verb could be taken as jussive, “let them wander about.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="PSA.58.7"><span class="content">Let them wither like grass!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The syntax of the Hebrew text is difficult and the meaning uncertain. The text reads literally, “he treads his arrows (following the Qere; Kethib has “his arrow”), like they are cut off/dry up.” It is not clear if the verbal root is מָלַל (malal, “circumcise”; BDB 576 s.v. IV מָלַל) or the homonymic מָלַל (“wither”; HALOT 593-94 s.v. I מלל). Since the verb מָלַל (“to wither”) is used of vegetation, it is possible that the noun חָצִיר (khatsir, “grass,” which is visually similar to חִצָּיו, khitsayv, “his arrows”) originally appeared in the text. The translation above assumes that the text originally was כְּמוֹ חָצִיר יִתְמֹלָלוּ(kÿmo khatsir yitmolalu, “like grass let them wither”). If original, it could have been accidentally corrupted to חִצָּיר כְּמוֹ יִתְמֹלָלוּ (“his arrow(s) like they dry up”) with דָּרַךְ (darakh, “to tread”) being added later in an effort to make sense of “his arrow(s).”</span></span></span></span></div>

Cohen (Psalms [SoBB], 184) explains that the text here alludes “to the popular belief that the slimy trail which the snail leaves in its track is the dissolution of its substance.”</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.58.8"><span class="content">Let them be like</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “let them be like” are supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons. The jussive mood is implied from the preceding context, and “like” is understood by ellipsis (see the previous line).</span></span></span><span class="content"> stillborn babies</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn This rare word also appears in Job 3:16 and Eccles 6:3.</span></span></span><span class="content"> that never see the sun!</span></span></div>

The translation assumes that within the cooking metaphor (see the previous line) חַי (khay, “living”) refers here to raw meat (as in 1 Sam 2:15, where it modifies בָּשָׂר, basar, “flesh”) and that חָרוּן (kharun; which always refers to God’s “burning anger” elsewhere) here refers to food that is cooked. The pronominal suffix on the verb “sweep away” apparently refers back to the “thorns” of the preceding line. The image depicts swift and sudden judgment. Before the fire has been adequately kindled and all the meat cooked, the winds of judgment will sweep away everything in their path.</span></span></span></span></div>

Occasionally the plural of majesty does take a plural attributive (see GKC 428-29 §132.h). It is possible that the final mem (ם) on the participle is enclitic, and that it was later misunderstood as a plural ending. Another option is to translate, “Yes indeed, there are gods who judge in the earth.” In this case, the statement reflects the polytheistic mindset of pagan observers who, despite their theological ignorance, nevertheless recognize divine retribution when they see it.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the earth!”</span></span></div>
