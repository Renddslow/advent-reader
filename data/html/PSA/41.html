         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 41</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 41. The psalmist is confident (vv. 11-12) that the Lord has heard his request to be healed (vv. 4-10), and he anticipates the joy he will experience when the Lord intervenes (vv. 1-3). One must assume that the psalmist is responding to a divine oracle of assurance (see P. C. Craigie, Psalms 1-50 [WBC], 319-20). The final verse is a fitting conclusion to this psalm, but it is also serves as a fitting conclusion to the first “book” (or major editorial division) of the Psalter. Similar statements appear at or near the end of each of the second, third, and fourth “books” of the Psalter (see Pss 72:19, 89:52, and 106:48 respectively).</span></span></span></span></div>

The word often refers metonymically to the happiness that God-given security and prosperity produce (see Pss 1:1, 3; 2:12; 34:9; 65:4; 84:12; 89:15; 106:3; 112:1; 127:5; 128:1; 144:15).</span></span></span><span class="content"> is the one who treats the poor properly!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn One who treats the poor properly. The psalmist is characterizing himself as such an individual and supplying a reason why God has responded favorably to his prayer. The Lord’s attitude toward the merciful mirrors their treatment of the poor.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.41.1"><span class="content">When trouble comes,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in the day of trouble” (see Ps 27:5).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> delivers him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn That is, the one who has been kind to the poor. The prefixed verbal form could be taken as jussive of prayer (“may the Lord deliver,” see v. 2), but the preceding parallel line is a declaration of fact, not a prayer per se. The imperfect can be taken here as future (“will deliver,” cf. NEB, NASB) or as generalizing (“delivers,” cf. NIV, NRSV). The parallel line, which has a generalizing tone, favors the latter. At the same time, though the psalmist uses a generalizing style here, he clearly has himself primarily in view.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.41.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> May the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> protect him and save his life!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The prefixed verbal forms are taken as jussives in the translation because the jussive is clearly used in the final line of the verse, suggesting that this is a prayer. The psalmist stops to pronounce a prayer of blessing on the godly individual envisioned in v. 1. Of course, he actually has himself primarily in view. He mixes confidence (vv. 1, 3) with petition (v. 2) because he stands in the interval between the word of assurance and the actual intervention by God.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.41.2"><span class="content">May he be blessed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The translation follows the consonantal Hebrew text (Kethib), which has a Pual (passive) prefixed form, regarded here as a jussive. The Pual of the verb אָשַׁר (’ashar) also appears in Prov 3:18. The marginal reading (Qere) assumes a vav (ו) consecutive and Pual perfect. Some, with the support of the LXX, change the verb to a Piel (active) form with an objective pronominal suffix, “and may he bless him,” or “and he will bless him” (cf. NIV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the land!</span></span></div>

Those who want to take v. 2 as a statement of confidence suggest emending the negative particle to לֹא (lo’), which is used with the imperfect. See the earlier note on the verbal forms in line one of this verse. According to GKC 322 §109.e, this is a case where the jussive is used rhetorically to “express that something cannot or should not happen.” In this case one might translate, “you will not turn him over to his enemies,” and take the preceding verbal forms as indicative in mood.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to his enemies!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “do not give him over to the desire of his enemies” (see Ps 27:12).</span></span></span></span></div>

The imperfect can be understood as future or as generalizing (see v. 1).</span></span></span><span class="content"> him on his sickbed;</span></span></div>
