         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 112</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 112. This wisdom psalm lists some of the benefits of living a godly life. The psalm is an acrostic. After the introductory call to praise, every poetic line (twenty-two in all) begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.</span></span></span></span></div>

The individual is representative of a larger group, called the “godly” in vv. 3-4. The principle of the psalm is certainly applicable to all people, regardless of their gender. To facilitate modern application, we translate the gender specific “man” with the more neutral “one.” The generic masculine pronoun is used in the following verses.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who obeys</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “fears.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">,</span></span></div>

Taking delight in the law is metonymic here for obeying God’s moral will. See Ps 1:2.</span></span></span></span></div>

See BDB 189-90 s.v. for other examples where “generation” refers to a class of people.</span></span></span><span class="content"> will be blessed.</span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.112.4"><span class="content">for each one who is merciful, compassionate, and just.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “merciful and compassionate and just.” The Hebrew text has three singular adjectives, which are probably substantival and in apposition to the “godly” (which is plural, however). By switching to the singular, the psalmist focuses on each individual member of the group known as the “godly.” Note how vv. 5-9, like vv. 1-2a, use the singular to describe the representative godly individual who typifies the whole group.</span></span></span></span></div>

The horn of the wild ox is frequently a metaphor for military strength; the idiom “exalt/lift up the horn” signifies military victory (see 1 Sam 2:10; Pss 89:17, 24; 92:10; Lam 2:17).</span></span></span></span></div>

Another possibility is that “desire” refers by metonymy to the object desired and acquired. In this case the point is that the wicked will lose what they desired so badly and acquired by evil means (see Ps 10:3).</span></span></span></span></div>
