(No matter which reading one chooses as original, dalet-resh confusion accounts for the existence of the variant.) The term זֵדִים (“proud ones”) occurs in parallelism with עָרִיצִים (’aritsim, “violent ones”) in Ps 86:14 and Isa 13:11. However, זָרִים (zarim, “foreigners”) is parallel to עָרִיצִים (’aritsim, “violent ones”) in Isa 25:5; 29:5; Ezek 28:7; 31:12.</span></span></span><span class="content"> attack me;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “rise against me.”</span></span></span></span></div>
