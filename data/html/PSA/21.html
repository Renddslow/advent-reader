The following context indicates that God’s “blessings” include deliverance/protection, vindication, sustained life, and a long, stable reign (see also Pss 3:8; 24:5).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.21.3"><span class="content">you place a golden crown on his head.</span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.21.4"><span class="content">and you have granted him long life and an enduring dynasty.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “you have granted him length of days forever and ever.” The phrase “length of days,” when used of human beings, usually refers to a lengthy period of time (such as one’s lifetime). See, for example, Deut 30:20; Job 12:12; Ps 91:16; Prov 3:2, 16; Lam 5:20. The additional phrase “forever and ever” is hyperbolic. While it seems to attribute eternal life to the king (see Pss 61:6-7; 72:5 as well), the underlying reality is the king’s enduring dynasty. He will live on, as it were, through his descendants, who will continue to rule over his kingdom long after he has passed off the scene.</span></span></span></span></div>

Note the focus of vv. 8-12 and see Ps 47:2.</span></span></span><span class="content"> faithfulness he is not upended.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Another option is to translate the imperfect verbal form as future, “he will not be upended” (cf. NRSV “he shall not be moved”). Even if one chooses this option, the future tense must be understood in a generalizing sense.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.21.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> You</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The king is now addressed. One could argue that the Lord is still being addressed, but v. 9 militates against this proposal, for there the Lord is mentioned in the third person and appears to be distinct from the addressee (unless, of course, one takes “Lord” in v. 9 as vocative; see the note on “them” in v. 9b). Verse 7 begins this transition to a new addressee by referring to both the king and the Lord in the third person (in vv. 1-6 the Lord is addressed and only the king referred to in the third person).</span></span></span><span class="content"> prevail over</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “your hand finds.” The idiom pictures the king grabbing hold of his enemies and defeating them (see 1 Sam 23:17). The imperfect verbal forms in vv. 8-12 may be translated with the future tense, as long as the future is understood as generalizing.</span></span></span><span class="content"> all your enemies;</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.21.8"><span class="content">your power is too great for those who hate you.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “your right hand finds those who hate you.”</span></span></span></span></div>

The point is not that he makes them like a furnace, but like an object burned in a furnace (cf. NEB, “at your coming you shall plunge them into a fiery furnace”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> when you appear;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “at the time of your face.” The “face” of the king here refers to his angry presence.

But this makes the use of the third person in v. 9b rather awkward, though the king could be the subject (see vv. 1-7).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="PSA.21.9"><span class="content">the fire consumes them.</span></span></div>

Another option is to translate with the past tense (“they intended…planned”).</span></span></span></span></div>
