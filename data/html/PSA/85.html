God’s people recall how he forgave their sins in the past, pray that he might now restore them to his favor, and anticipate renewed blessings.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">For the music director; written by the Korahites, a psalm.</span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.85.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> O </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, you showed favor to your land;</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.85.1"><span class="content">you restored the well-being of Jacob.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “you turned with a turning [toward] Jacob.” The Hebrew term שְׁבוּת (shÿvut) is apparently a cognate accusative of שׁוּב (shuv). See Pss 14:7; 53:6.</span></span></span></span></div>

Synonyms are joined in a construct relationship to emphasize the single idea. For a detailed discussion of the grammatical point with numerous examples, see Y. Avishur, “Pairs of Synonymous Words in the Construct State (and in Appositional Hendiadys) in Biblical Hebrew,” Semitics 2 (1971): 17-81. See Pss 69:24; 78:49.</span></span></span></span></div>

Having asked for the Lord’s favor, the psalmist (who here represents the nation) anticipates a divine word of assurance.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.85.8"><span class="content">For he will make</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “speak.” The idiom “speak peace” refers to establishing or maintaining peaceful relations with someone (see Gen 37:4; Zech 9:10; cf. Ps 122:8).</span></span></span><span class="content"> peace with his people, his faithful followers.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “to his people and to his faithful followers.” The translation assumes that “his people” and “his faithful followers” are viewed as identical here.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PSA.85.8"><span class="content">Yet they must not</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “yet let them not.” After the negative particle אֵל (’el), the prefixed verbal form is jussive, indicating the speaker’s desire or wish.</span></span></span><span class="content"> return to their foolish ways.</span></span></div>

The infinitive with -לְ (lÿ), “to dwell,” probably indicates result here (“then”). When God delivers his people and renews his relationship with them, he will once more reveal his royal splendor in the land.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="PSA.85.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content"> Loyal love and faithfulness meet;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The psalmist probably uses the perfect verbal forms in v. 10 in a dramatic or rhetorical manner, describing what he anticipates as if it were already occurring or had already occurred.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="PSA.85.10"><span class="content">deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.

The repetition of the word emphasizes that agricultural prosperity is the direct result of divine blessing.</span></span></span><span class="content"> its crops.</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="PSA.85.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> Deliverance goes</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “will go.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> before him,</span></span></div>

This could be translated, “and peace [goes ahead, making] a pathway for his footsteps” (cf. NEB).</span></span></span></span></div>
