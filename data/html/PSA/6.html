         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 6</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 6. The psalmist begs the Lord to withdraw his anger and spare his life. Having received a positive response to his prayer, the psalmist then confronts his enemies and describes how they retreat.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the </span><span class="it"><span class="heading">sheminith</span></span><span class="heading"> style;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn The meaning of the Hebrew term שְׁמִינִית (shÿminit, “sheminith”) is uncertain; perhaps it refers to a particular style of music. See 1 Chr 15:21.</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> a psalm of David.</span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.6.1"><span class="content">Do not discipline me in your raging fury!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The implication is that the psalmist has sinned, causing God to discipline him by bringing a life-threatening illness upon him (see vv. 2-7).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.6.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> Have mercy on me,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “show me favor.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, for I am frail!</span></span></div>

Perhaps here the “bones” are viewed as the seat of the psalmist’s emotions. However, the verb may describe one of the effects of his physical ailment, perhaps a fever. In Ezek 7:27 the verb describes how the hands of the people will shake with fear when they experience the horrors of divine judgment.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.6.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> I am absolutely terrified,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my being is very terrified.” The suffixed form of נֶפֶשׁ (nefesh, “being”) is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.</span></span></span></span></div>

He addresses God, but then simply cries out with a brief, but poignant, question: How long will this (= his suffering) continue?</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.6.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> Relent, </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">, rescue me!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my being,” or “my life.” The suffixed form of נֶפֶשׁ (nefesh, “being”) is often equivalent to a pronoun in poetic texts.</span></span></span></span></div>

Though the psalmist is experiencing divine discipline, he realizes that God has made a commitment to him in the past, so he appeals to God’s faithfulness in his request for help.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.6.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> For no one remembers you in the realm of death,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “for there is not in death your remembrance.” The Hebrew noun זֵכֶר (zekher, “remembrance”) here refers to the name of the Lord as invoked in liturgy and praise. Cf. Pss 30:4; 97:12. “Death” here refers to the realm of death where the dead reside. See the reference to Sheol in the next line.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PSA.6.5"><span class="content">In Sheol who gives you thanks?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The rhetorical question anticipates the answer, “no one.”sn In Sheol who gives you thanks? According to the OT, those who descend into the realm of death/Sheol are cut off from God’s mighty deeds and from the worshiping covenant community that experiences divine intervention (Pss 30:9; 88:10-12; Isa 38:18). In his effort to elicit a positive divine response, the psalmist reminds God that he will receive no praise or glory if he allows the psalmist to die. Dead men do not praise God!</span></span></span></span></div>
