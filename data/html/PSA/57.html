         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 57</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 57. The psalmist asks for God’s protection and expresses his confidence that his ferocious enemies will be destroyed by their own schemes.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="s2"><span class="heading">For the music director; according to the </span><span class="it"><span class="heading">al-tashcheth</span></span><span class="heading"> style;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn Heb “do not destroy.” Perhaps this refers to a particular style of music, a tune title, or a musical instrument. These words also appear in the heading to Pss 58-59, 75.</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> a prayer</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">tn The precise meaning of the Hebrew word מִכְתָּם (miktam), which also appears in the heading to Pss 16, 56, 58-60 is uncertain. HALOT 582-83 s.v. defines it as “inscription.”</span></span></span></span><span class="heading"> of David, written when he fled from Saul into the cave.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn According to the superscription, David wrote this psalm on the occasion when he fled from Saul and hid in “the cave.” This probably refers to either the incident recorded in 1 Sam 22:1 or to the one recorded in 1 Sam 24:3.</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.57.1"><span class="content">In the shadow of your wings</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn In the shadow of your wings. The metaphor likens God to a protective mother bird (see also Pss 17:8; 36:7).</span></span></span><span class="content"> I take shelter</span></span></div>

See especially Ps 47:2.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.57.2"><span class="content">to the God who vindicates</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “avenges in favor of.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> me.</span></span></div>

The second verb, which has a vav (ו) conjunctive prefixed to it, probably indicates purpose. Another option is to take the forms as imperfects expressing confidence, “he will send from heaven and deliver me” (cf. NRSV).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PSA.57.3"><span class="content">from my enemies who hurl insults!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “he hurls insults, one who crushes me.” The translation assumes that this line identifies those from whom the psalmist seeks deliverance. (The singular is representative; the psalmist is surrounded by enemies, see v. 4.) Another option is to understand God as the subject of the verb חָרַף (kharaf), which could then be taken as a homonym of the more common root חָרַף (“insult”) meaning “confuse.” In this case “one who crushes me” is the object of the verb. One might translate, “he [God] confuses my enemies.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> (Selah)</span></span></div>

One possibility is that the form here is a “pseudo-cohortative” used here in a gnomic sense (IBHS 576-77 §34.5.3b).</span></span></span><span class="content"> among those who want to devour me;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew verb לָהַט (lahat) is here understood as a hapax legomenon meaning “devour” (see HALOT 521 s.v. II להט), a homonym of the more common verb meaning “to burn.” A more traditional interpretation takes the verb from this latter root and translates, “those who are aflame” (see BDB 529 s.v.; cf. NASB “those who breathe forth fire”).</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.57.4"><span class="content">men whose teeth are spears and arrows,</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PSA.57.4"><span class="content">whose tongues are a sharp sword.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “my life, in the midst of lions, I lie down, devouring ones, sons of mankind, their teeth a spear and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.” The syntax of the verse is difficult. Another option is to take “my life” with the preceding verse. For this to make sense, one must add a verb, perhaps “and may he deliver” (cf. the LXX), before the phrase. One might then translate, “May God send his loyal love and faithfulness and deliver my life.” If one does take “my life” with v. 4, then the parallelism of v. 5 is altered and one might translate: “in the midst of lions I lie down, [among] men who want to devour me, whose teeth….”</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PSA.57.6"><span class="content">They have dug a pit for me.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “before me.”</span></span></span></span></div>

Some view כָּבוֹד (kavod, “glory”) here as a metonymy for man’s inner being (see BDB 459 s.v. II כָּבוֹד 5), but it is preferable to emend the form to כְּבֵדִי (kÿvediy, “my liver”). Like the heart, the liver is viewed as the seat of one’s emotions. See also Pss 16:9; 30:12; 108:1, as well as H. W. Wolff, Anthropology of the Old Testament, 64, and M. Dahood, Psalms (AB), 1:90. For an Ugaritic example of the heart/liver as the source of joy, see G. R. Driver, Canaanite Myths and Legends, 47-48: “her [Anat’s] liver swelled with laughter, her heart was filled with joy, the liver of Anat with triumph.”</span></span></span></span></div>

When salvation “dawns,” the psalmist will “wake up” in praise.</span></span></span></span></div>
