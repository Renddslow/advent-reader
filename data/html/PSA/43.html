         <div class="s1"><span class="heading">Psalm 43</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft"><span class="heading">sn Psalm 43. Many medieval Hebrew mss combine Psalm 43 and Psalm 42 into one psalm. Psalm 43 is the only psalm in Book 2 of the Psalter (Psalms 42-72) that does not have a heading, suggesting that it was originally the third and concluding section of Psalm 42. Ps 43:5 is identical to the refrain in Ps 42:11 and almost identical to the refrain in Ps 42:5.</span></span></span></span></div>

See also v. 3.</span></span></span><span class="content"> from deceitful and evil men!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “from the deceitful and evil man.” The Hebrew text uses the singular form “man” in a collective sense, as the reference to a “nation” in the parallel line indicates.</span></span></span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="PSA.43.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> For you are the God who shelters me.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “God of my place of refuge,” that is, “God who is my place of refuge.” See Ps 31:4.</span></span></span></span></div>

See Ps 38:6 for a similar statement.</span></span></span></span></div>

Synonyms are joined in a construct relationship to emphasize the degree of the psalmist’s joy. For a detailed discussion of the grammatical point with numerous examples, see Y. Avishur, “Pairs of Synonymous Words in the Construct State (and in Appositional Hendiadys) in Biblical Hebrew,” Semitics 2 (1971): 17-81.</span></span></span></span></div>
