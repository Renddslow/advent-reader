The psalmist observes that the human race is morally corrupt. Evildoers oppress God’s people, but the psalmist is confident of God’s protection and anticipates a day when God will vindicate Israel.</span></span></span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="PSA.14.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> Fools say to themselves,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a fool says in his heart.” The singular is used here in a collective or representative sense; the typical fool is envisioned.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “There is no God.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn “There is no God.” The statement is probably not a philosophical assertion that God does not exist, but rather a confident affirmation that God is unconcerned about how men live morally and ethically (see Ps 10:4, 11).</span></span></span></span></div>

The subject of the plural verbs is “sons of man” (v. 2). The entire human race is characterized by sinful behavior. This practical atheism – living as if there is no God who will hold them accountable for their actions – makes them fools, for one of the earmarks of folly is to fail to anticipate the long range consequences of one’s behavior.</span></span></span></span></div>

This may refer to their lack of moral understanding, but it more likely refers to their failure to anticipate God’s defense of his people (see vv. 5-7).</span></span></span></span></div>

The adverb שָׁם (sham, “there”) is also used here for dramatic effect, as the psalmist envisions the wicked standing in fear at a spot that is this vivid in his imagination (BDB 1027 s.v.). The cognate accusative following the verb emphasizes the degree of their terror.</span></span></span></span></div>

See BDB 190 s.v. for other examples where “generation” refers to a class of people.</span></span></span></span></div>

Since the context indicates their attempt to harm the godly will be thwarted, the imperfect should be taken in a subjunctive (cf. NASB, NRSV) rather than an indicative manner (cf. NIV). Here it probably expresses their desire or intent (“want to humiliate”).</span></span></span></span></div>
