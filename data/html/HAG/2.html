The twenty-first day of Tishri marked the seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles (Num 29:32-34).

There surely would have been some older people who remembered the former splendor of that magnificent structure and who lamented the contrast to the small, unimpressive temple they were building (see Ezra 3:8-13).</span></span></span><span class="content"> How does it look to you now?

The proposed emendation makes excellent sense and is expected with the verb כָּרַת (karat, “cut” or “make” a covenant), but it has no textual support.
