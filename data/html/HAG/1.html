ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV) can be understood to mean that Jehozadak was high priest. However, Zech 3:1, 8 clearly indicates that Joshua was high priest (see also Ezra 5:1-2; cf. NAB). The same potential misunderstanding occurs in Hag 1:12, 14 and 2:2, where the same solution has been employed in the translation.</span></span></span></span></div>

This name (יְהוָה צְבָאוֹת, yÿhvah tsÿva’ot), traditionally translated “Lord of hosts” (so KJV, NAB, NASB; cf. NIV, NLT “Lord Almighty”; NCV, CEV “Lord All-Powerful”), emphasizes the majestic sovereignty of the Lord, an especially important concept in the postexilic world of great human empires and rulers. For a thorough study of the divine title, see T. N. D. Mettinger, In Search of God, 123-57.</span></span></span><span class="content"> says this: “These people have said, ‘The time for rebuilding the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s temple has not yet come.’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “the time has not come, the time for the house of the Lord to be built” (similar KJV). A number of English versions refer to “rebuilding” (so NAB, NCV, NRSV, TEV, NLT) since the reconstruction of Solomon’s temple is actually in view.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="HAG.1.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> So the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> spoke through the prophet Haggai as follows:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying.” Cf. the similar expression in v. 1 and the note there.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="HAG.1.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> “Is it right for you to live in richly paneled houses</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Richly paneled houses. Paneling is otherwise known in the OT only in connection with the temple (1 Kgs 6:9) and the royal palace (2 Kgs 7:3, 7). It implies decoration and luxury (cf. NCV “fancy houses”; TEV “well-built houses”; NLT “luxurious houses”). The impropriety of the people living in such lavish accommodations while the temple lay unfinished is striking.</span></span></span><span class="content"> while my temple is in ruins?</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Is it time for you, [yes] you, to live in paneled houses, while this house is in ruins”; NASB “lies desolate”; NIV “remains a ruin.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="HAG.1.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Here then is what the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> who rules over all says: ‘Think carefully about what you are doing.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Set your heart upon your ways” (see 2:15, 18); traditionally “Consider your ways” (so KJV, ASV, NAB, NASB).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="HAG.1.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> You have planted much, but have harvested little.

Because coinage had been invented by the Persians and was thus in use in Haggai’s day, this likely is a money bag or purse rather than pouches or pockets in the clothing. Since in contemporary English “purse” (so NASB, NIV, NCV) could be understood as a handbag, the present translation uses “money bags.”</span></span></span></span></div>
