         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="HEB.1.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> After God spoke long ago</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “spoke formerly.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in various portions</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “parts.” The idea is that God’s previous revelation came in many parts and was therefore fragmentary or partial (L&amp;N 63.19), in comparison with the final and complete revelation contained in God’s Son. However, some interpret πολυμερῶς (polumerw&quot;) in Heb 1:1 to mean “on many different occasions” and would thus translate “many times” (L&amp;N 67.11). This is the option followed by the NIV: “at many times and in various ways.” Finally, this word is also understood to refer to the different manners in which something may be done, and would then be translated “in many different ways” (L&amp;N 89.81). In this last case, the two words πολυμερῶς and πολυτρόπως (polutropw&quot;) mutually reinforce one another (“in many and various ways,” NRSV).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and in various ways</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn These two phrases are emphasized in Greek by being placed at the beginning of the sentence and by alliteration.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to our ancestors</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to the fathers.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> through the prophets, </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="HEB.1.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> in these last days he has spoken to us in a son,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Greek puts an emphasis on the quality of God’s final revelation. As such, it is more than an indefinite notion (“a son”) though less than a definite one (“the son”), for this final revelation is not just through any son of God, nor is the emphasis specifically on the person himself. Rather, the focus here is on the nature of the vehicle of God’s revelation: He is no mere spokesman (or prophet) for God, nor is he merely a heavenly messenger (or angel); instead, this final revelation comes through one who is intimately acquainted with the heavenly Father in a way that only a family member could be. There is, however, no exact equivalent in English (“in son” is hardly good English style).sn The phrase in a son is the fulcrum of Heb 1:1-4. It concludes the contrast of God’s old and new revelation and introduces a series of seven descriptions of the Son. These descriptions show why he is the ultimate revelation of God.</span></span></span><span class="content"> whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the world.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the ages.” The temporal (ages) came to be used of the spatial (what exists in those time periods).

NAB, NIV, NRSV, CEV). However, the Son is the subject of both the first and second elements: “he became so far better”; “he has inherited a name.” The present translation maintains this parallelism even though it results in a somewhat more awkward rendering.sn This comparison is somewhat awkward to express in English, but it reflects an important element in the argument of Hebrews: the superiority of Jesus Christ.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he has inherited a name superior to theirs.</span></span></div>

The imagery of God being the Son’s throne would seem to be of God being his authority. If so, in what sense could this not be said of the angels? In what sense is the Son thus contrasted with the angels? (2) The μέν…δέ (men…de) construction that connects v. 7 with v. 8 clearly lays out this contrast: “On the one hand, he says of the angels…on the other hand, he says of the Son.” Thus, although it is grammatically possible that θεός (qeos) in v. 8 should be taken as a predicate nominative, the context and the correlative conjunctions are decidedly against it. Hebrews 1:8 is thus a strong affirmation of the deity of Christ.</span></span></span></span></div>
