BDAG 1037 s.v. 2 lists both Heb 8:5 and 9:23 under the second category of usage, “an indication of someth. that appears at a subsequent time,” emphasizing the temporal progression between the earthly and heavenly sanctuaries.sn There are two main options for understanding the conceptual background of the heavenly sanctuary imagery. The first is to understand the imagery to be functioning on a vertical plane. This background is Hellenistic, philosophical, and spatial in orientation and sees the earthly sanctuary as a copy of the heavenly reality. The other option is to see the imagery functioning on a horizontal plane. This background is Jewish, eschatological, and temporal and sees the heavenly sanctuary as the fulfillment and true form of the earthly sanctuary which preceded it. The second option is preferred, both for lexical reasons (see tn above) and because it fits the Jewish context of the book (although many scholars prefer to emphasize the relationship the book has to Hellenistic thought).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle.

This is in keeping with the horizontal imagery accepted for this verse (see sn on “sketch” earlier in the verse). Here Moses was shown the future heavenly sanctuary which, though it did not yet exist, became the outline for the earthly sanctuary.</span></span></span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content"> shown to you on the mountain</span></span></span><span class="content">.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Exod 25:40.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="HEB.8.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> But</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The Greek text indicates a contrast between vv. 4-5 and v. 6 that is difficult to render in English: Jesus’ status in the old order of priests (vv. 4-5) versus his superior ministry (v. 6).</span></span></span><span class="content"> now Jesus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he”; in the translation the referent (Jesus) has been specified for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> has obtained a superior ministry, since</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to the degree that.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “which is enacted.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> on better promises.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This linkage of the change in priesthood with a change in the law or the covenant goes back to Heb 7:12, 22 and is picked up again in Heb 9:6-15 and 10:1-18.</span></span></span></span></div>

(The verb μέμφομαι [memfomai, “to find fault with”] can take an accusative or dative direct object.) The reading behind the text above (αὐτοίς, autoi&quot;), supported by Ì46 א2 B D2 0278 1739 1881 Ï, is perhaps a harder reading theologically, and is more ambiguous in meaning. If αὐτοίς goes with μεμφόμενος (memfomeno&quot;, here translated “showing its fault”), the clause could be translated “in finding fault with them” or “in showing [its] faults to them.” If αὐτοίς goes with the following λέγει (legei, “he says”), the clause is best translated, “in finding/showing [its] faults, he says to them.” The accusative pronoun suffers no such ambiguity, for it must be the object of μεμφόμενος rather than λέγει. Although a decision is difficult, the dative form of the pronoun best explains the rise of the other reading and is thus more likely to be original.</span></span></span></span></div>
