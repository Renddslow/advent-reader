There are a few other variants here (e.g., συγκεκεραμμένοι [sunkekerammenoi] in 104, συγκεκεραμένους [sunkekeramenou&quot;] in 1881 Ï), but the accusative plural participle συγκεκερασμένους (sunkekerasmenou&quot;), found in Ì13vid,46 A B C D* Ψ 0243 0278 33 81 1739 2464 pc, has by far the best external credentials. This participle agrees with the previous ἐκείνους (ekeinou&quot;, “those”), a more difficult construction grammatically than the nominative singular. Thus, both on external and internal grounds, συγκεκερασμένους is preferred.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="HEB.4.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “</span><span class="it"><span class="bd"><span class="content">As I swore in my anger</span></span><span class="content">, </span></span><span class="content">‘</span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">They will never enter my rest!</span></span></span><span class="content">’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Ps 95:11.</span></span></span><span class="content"> And yet God’s works</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “although the works,” continuing the previous reference to God.
