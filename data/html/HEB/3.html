The external evidence for the omission, though minimal, has excellent credentials. Considering the internal factors, B. M. Metzger (TCGNT 595) finds it surprising that the feminine adjective βεβαίαν should modify the neuter noun καύχημα (kauchma, here translated “we take pride”), a fact that suggests that even the form of the word was borrowed from another place. Since the same phrase occurs at Heb 3:14, it is likely that later scribes added it here at Heb 3:6 in anticipation of Heb 3:14. While these words belong at 3:14, they seem foreign to 3:6.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the pride of our hope.”</span></span></span></span></div>
