The adjective πιστικῆς (pistikh&quot;) is difficult with regard to its exact meaning; some have taken it to derive from πίστις (pistis) and relate to the purity of the oil of nard. More probably it is something like a brand name, “pistic nard,” the exact significance of which has not been discovered.sn Nard or spikenard is a fragrant oil from the root and spike of the nard plant of northern India.

With a note characteristic of someone who was there and remembered, the author adds that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil. In the later rabbinic literature, Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7.1.1 states “The fragrance of good oil is diffused from the bedroom to the dining hall, but a good name is diffused from one end of the world to the other.” If such a saying was known in the 1st century, this might be the author’s way of indicating that Mary’s act of devotion would be spoken of throughout the entire world (compare the comment in Mark 14:9).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JHN.12.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This is a parenthetical note by the author.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said, </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JHN.12.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> “Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “three hundred denarii.” The denarius was a silver coin worth a standard day’s wage, so the value exceeded what a laborer could earn in a year (taking into account Sabbaths and feast days when no work was done).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the money</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “the money” are not in the Greek text, but are implied (as the proceeds from the sale of the perfumed oil).</span></span></span><span class="content"> given to the poor?” </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JHN.12.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> (Now Judas</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he”; the referent (Judas) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief.

This is one of the indications in the gospels that Judas was of bad character before the betrayal of Jesus. John states that he was a thief and had responsibility for the finances of the group. More than being simply a derogatory note about Judas’ character, the inclusion of the note at this particular point in the narrative may be intended to link the frustrated greed of Judas here with his subsequent decision to betray Jesus for money. The parallel accounts in Matthew and Mark seem to indicate that after this incident Judas went away immediately and made his deal with the Jewish authorities to deliver up Jesus. Losing out on one source of sordid gain, he immediately went out and set up another.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="JHN.12.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content"> So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Leave her alone, that for the day of my burial she may keep it.” The construction with ἵνα (Jina) is somewhat ambiguous. The simplest way to read it would be, “Leave her alone, that she may keep it for the day of my burial.” This would imply that Mary was going to use the perfumed oil on that day, while vv. 3 and 5 seem to indicate clearly that she had already used it up. Some understand the statement as elliptical: “Leave her alone; (she did this) in order to keep it for the day of my burial.” Another alternative would be an imperatival use of ἵνα with the meaning: “Leave her alone; let her keep it.” The reading of the Byzantine text, which omits the ἵνα and substitutes a perfect tense τετήρηκεν (tethrhken), while not likely to be original, probably comes close to the meaning of the text, and that has been followed in this translation.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JHN.12.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content"> For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc A few isolated witnesses omit v. 8 (D sys), part of v. 8 (Ì75), or vv. 7-8 ({0250}). The latter two omissions are surely due to errors of sight, while the former can be attributed to D’s sometimes erratic behavior. The verse is secure in light of the overwhelming evidence on its behalf.tn In the Greek text of this clause, “me” is in emphatic position (the first word in the clause). To convey some impression of the emphasis, an exclamation point is used in the translation.</span></span></span></span></div>

In words familiar to every Jew, the author is indicating that at this point every messianic expectation is now at the point of realization. It is clear from the words of the psalm shouted by the crowd that Jesus is being proclaimed as messianic king. See E. Lohse, TDNT 9:682-84.sn Hosanna is an Aramaic expression that literally means, “help, I pray,” or “save, I pray.” By Jesus’ time it had become a strictly liturgical formula of praise, however, and was used as an exclamation of praise to God.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span><span class="bd"><span class="it"><span class="content">Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!</span></span></span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A quotation from Ps 118:25-26.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Blessed is</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.” The words “Blessed is” are not repeated in the Greek text, but are repeated in the translation to avoid the awkwardness in English of the ascensive καί (kai).</span></span></span><span class="content"> the king of Israel!” </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="JHN.12.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> Jesus found a young donkey</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The author does not repeat the detailed accounts of the finding of the donkey recorded in the synoptic gospels.

As far as the author’s account is concerned, Jesus totally ignores these Greeks and makes no further reference to them whatsoever. It appears that his words are addressed to Andrew and Philip, but in fact they must have had a wider audience, including possibly the Greeks who had wished to see him in the first place. The words the time has come recall all the previous references to “the hour” throughout the Fourth Gospel (see the note on time in 2:4). There is no doubt, in light of the following verse, that Jesus refers to his death here.

None of these passages are in the Pentateuch per se, but “law” could in common usage refer to the entire OT (compare Jesus’ use in John 10:34).

On the basis of statements like 1:14 in the prologue, the author probably put no great distinction between the two. Since the author presents Jesus as fully God (cf.
