         <div class="p"><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="JHN.9.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content"> Now as Jesus was passing by,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “going along.” The opening words of chap. 9, καὶ παράγων (kai paragwn), convey only the vaguest indication of the circumstances. sn Since there is no break with chap. 8, Jesus is presumably still in Jerusalem, and presumably not still in the temple area. The events of chap. 9 fall somewhere between the feast of Tabernacles (John 7:2) and the feast of the Dedication (John 10:22). But in the author’s narrative the connection exists – the incident recorded in chap. 9 (along with the ensuing debates with the Pharisees) serves as a real-life illustration of the claim Jesus made in 8:12, I am the light of the world. This is in fact the probable theological motivation behind the juxtaposition of these two incidents in the narrative. The second serves as an illustration of the first, and as a concrete example of the victory of light over darkness. One other thing which should be pointed out about the miracle recorded in chap. 9 is its messianic significance. In the OT it is God himself who is associated with the giving of sight to the blind (Exod 4:11, Ps 146:8). In a number of passages in Isa (29:18, 35:5, 42:7) it is considered to be a messianic activity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> he saw a man who had been blind from birth. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="JHN.9.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> His disciples asked him,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “asked him, saying.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Rabbi, who committed the sin that caused him to be born blind, this man</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “this one.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> or his parents?”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “in order that he should be born blind.”sn The disciples assumed that sin (regardless of who committed it) was the cause of the man’s blindness. This was a common belief in Judaism; the rabbis used Ezek 18:20 to prove there was no death without sin, and Ps 89:33 to prove there was no punishment without guilt (the Babylonian Talmud, b. Shabbat 55a, although later than the NT, illustrates this). Thus in this case the sin must have been on the part of the man’s parents, or during his own prenatal existence. Song Rabbah 1:41 (another later rabbinic work) stated that when a pregnant woman worshiped in a heathen temple the unborn child also committed idolatry. This is only one example of how, in rabbinic Jewish thought, an unborn child was capable of sinning.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JHN.9.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Jesus answered, “Neither this man</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “this one.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> nor his parents sinned, but he was born blind so that</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “but so that.” There is an ellipsis that must be supplied: “but [he was born blind] so that” or “but [it happened to him] so that.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the acts</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “deeds”; Grk “works.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of God may be revealed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “manifested,” “brought to light.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> through what happens to him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “in him.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JHN.9.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> We must perform the deeds</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “We must work the works.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of the one who sent me</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “of him who sent me” (God).</span></span></span><span class="content"> as long as</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “while.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> it is daytime.

Here (seen more clearly than at 8:12) it is obvious what the author sees as the significance of Jesus’ statement. “Light” is not a metaphysical definition of the person of Jesus but a description of his effect on the world, forcing everyone in the world to ‘choose up sides’ for or against him (cf. 3:19-21).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JHN.9.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Having said this,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “said these things.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> he spat on the ground and made some mud</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “clay” (moistened earth of a clay-like consistency). The textual variant preserved in the Syriac text of Ephraem’s commentary on the Diatessaron (“he made eyes from his clay”) probably arose from the interpretation given by Irenaeus in Against Heresies: “that which the Artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, he then supplied in public.” This involves taking the clay as an allusion to Gen 2:7, which is very unlikely.</span></span></span><span class="content"> with the saliva.

The Pharisees had put this man on the spot, and he felt compelled to say something about Jesus, but he still didn’t have a clear conception of who Jesus was, so he labeled him a “prophet.”</span></span></span></span></div>

There is no substantial evidence for a formal ban on Christians until later than this Gospel could possibly have been written. This may be a reference to some form of excommunication adopted as a contingency to deal with those who were proclaiming Jesus to be the Messiah.

In the Johannine context the word would connote its full sense: This was something due God alone. Note also that Jesus did not prevent the man from doing this. The verb προσκυνέω (proskunew) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. This would be the only place in John’s Gospel where anyone is said to have worshiped Jesus using this term. As such, it forms the climax of the story of the man born blind, but the uniqueness of the concept of worshiping Jesus at this point in John&apos;s narrative (which reaches its ultimate climax in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28) may suggest it is too early for such a response and it represents a later scribal addition.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="JHN.9.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content"> Jesus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “And Jesus.” Because of the difference between Greek style, which often begins sentences or clauses with “and,” and English style, which generally does not, καί (kai) has not been translated here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said,]</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc ‡ Some early and important witnesses (Ì75 א* W b sams ac2 mf) lack the words, “He said, ‘Lord, I believe,’ and he worshiped him. Jesus said,” (vv. 38-39a). This is weighty evidence for the omission of these words. It is difficult to overstate the value of Ì75 here, since it is the only currently available papyrus ms extant for the text of John 9:38-39. Further, א is an important and early Alexandrian witness for the omission. The versional testimony and codex W also give strong support to the omission. Nearly all other mss, however, include these words. The omission may have been occasioned by parablepsis (both vv. 37 and 39 begin with “Jesus said to him”), though it is difficult to account for such an error across such a wide variety of witnesses. On the other hand, the longer reading appears to be motivated by liturgical concerns (so R. E. Brown, John [AB], 1:375), since the verb προσκυνέω (proskunew, “I worship”) is used in John 4:20-25 of worshiping God, and again with the same sense in 12:20. If these words were authentic here, this would be the only place in John’s Gospel where Jesus is the explicit object of προσκυνέω. Even if these words are not authentic, such an omission would nevertheless hardly diminish John’s high Christology (cf. 1:1; 5:18-23; 14:6-10; 20:28), nor the implicit worship of him by Thomas (20:28). Nevertheless, a decision is difficult, and the included words may reflect a very early tradition about the blind man’s response to Jesus.</span></span></span><span class="content"> “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may gain their sight,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “that those who do not see may see.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the ones who see may become blind.”</span></span></div>

The blind man received sight physically, and this led him to see spiritually as well. But the Pharisees, who claimed to possess spiritual sight, were spiritually blinded. The reader might recall Jesus’ words to Nicodemus in 3:10, “Are you the teacher of Israel and don’t understand these things?” In other words, to receive Jesus was to receive the light of the world, to reject him was to reject the light, close one’s eyes, and become blind. This is the serious sin of which Jesus had warned before (8:21-24). The blindness of such people was incurable since they had rejected the only cure that exists (cf. 12:39-41).</span></span></span></span></div>
