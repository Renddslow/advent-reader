It is a bit surprising that the author here identifies Mary as the one who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, since this event is not mentioned until later, in 12:3. Many see this “proleptic” reference as an indication that the author expected his readers to be familiar with the story already, and go on to assume that in general the author in writing the Fourth Gospel assumed his readers were familiar with the other three gospels. Whether the author assumed actual familiarity with the synoptic gospels or not, it is probable that he did assume some familiarity with Mary’s anointing activity.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JHN.11.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> So the sisters sent a message</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “a message” is not in the Greek text but is implied.

Johannine double-meanings abound here: Even though death would not be the end of the matter, Lazarus is going to die; and ultimately his death and resurrection would lead to the death and resurrection of the Son of God (11:45-53). Furthermore, the glorification of the Son is not praise that comes to him for the miracle, but his death, resurrection, and return to the Father which the miracle precipitates (note the response of the Jewish authorities in 11:47-53).</span></span></span><span class="content"> but to God’s glory,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “to God’s praise.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn So that the Son of God may be glorified through it. These statements are highly ironic: For Lazarus, the sickness did not end in his death, because he was restored to life. But for Jesus himself, the miraculous sign he performed led to his own death, because it confirmed the authorities in their plan to kill Jesus (11:47-53). In the Gospel of John, Jesus’ death is consistently portrayed as his ‘glorification’ through which he accomplishes his return to the Father.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JHN.11.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This is a parenthetical note by the author.

This metaphorical usage by its very nature emphasizes the hope of resurrection: Believers will one day “wake up” out of death. Here the term refers to death, but “asleep” was used in the translation to emphasize the metaphorical, rhetorical usage of the term, especially in light of the disciples’ confusion over what Jesus actually meant (see v. 13).</span></span></span><span class="content"> But I am going there to awaken him.” </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="JHN.11.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> Then the disciples replied,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Then the disciples said to him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="JHN.11.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> (Now Jesus had been talking about</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “speaking about.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> his death, but they</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “these.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> thought he had been talking about real sleep.)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “the sleep of slumber”; this is a redundant expression to emphasize physical sleep as opposed to death.sn This is a parenthetical note by the author.</span></span></span></span></div>

Why does Jesus make this statement? It seems necessary to understand the disciples’ belief here in a developmental sense, because there are numerous references to the disciples’ faith previous to this in John’s Gospel, notably 2:11. Their concept of who Jesus really was is continually being expanded and challenged; they are undergoing spiritual growth; the climax is reached in the confession of Thomas in John 20:28.</span></span></span><span class="content"> But let us go to him.” </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JHN.11.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> So Thomas (called Didymus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Didymus means “the twin” in Greek.</span></span></span><span class="content">)</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This is a parenthetical note by the author.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn One gets the impression from Thomas’ statement “Let us go too, so that we may die with him” that he was something of a pessimist resigned to his fate. And yet his dedicated loyalty to Jesus and his determination to accompany him at all costs was truly commendable. Nor is the contrast between this statement and the confession of Thomas in 20:28, which forms the climax of the entire Fourth Gospel, to be overlooked; certainly Thomas’ concept of who Jesus is has changed drastically between 11:16 and 20:28.</span></span></span></span></div>

The author simply states that when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already. He had died some time before this but probably not very long (cf. Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:6,10 who were buried immediately after they died, as was the common practice of the time). There is some later evidence (early 3rd century) of a rabbinic belief that the soul hovered near the body of the deceased for three days, hoping to be able to return to the body. But on the fourth day it saw the beginning of decomposition and finally departed (Leviticus Rabbah 18.1). If this belief is as old as the 1st century, it might suggest the significance of the four days: After this time, resurrection would be a first-order miracle, an unequivocal demonstration of the power of God. It is not certain if the tradition is this early, but it is suggestive. Certainly the author does not appear to attach any symbolic significance to the four days in the narrative.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JHN.11.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> (Now Bethany was less than two miles</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “three kilometers”; Grk “fifteen stades” (a stade as a unit of linear measure is about 607 feet or 187 meters).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from Jerusalem,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="JHN.11.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content"> so many of the Jewish people of the region</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “many of the Judeans” (cf.

However, Martha’s statement in 11:39 makes it clear that she had no idea that a resurrection was still possible. How then are her words in 11:22 to be understood? It seems best to take them as a confession of Martha’s continuing faith in Jesus even though he was not there in time to help her brother. She means, in effect, “Even though you weren’t here in time to help, I still believe that God grants your requests.”</span></span></span></span></div>

Martha apparently took it as a customary statement of consolation and joined Jesus in professing belief in the general resurrection of the body at the end of the age. However, as Jesus went on to point out in 11:25-26, Martha’s general understanding of the resurrection at the last day was inadequate for the present situation, for the gift of life that conquers death was a present reality to Jesus. This is consistent with the author’s perspective on eternal life in the Fourth Gospel: It is not only a future reality, but something to be experienced in the present as well. It is also consistent with the so-called “realized eschatology” of the Fourth Gospel.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="JHN.11.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content"> Martha said,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Martha said to him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “I know that he will come back to life again</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “will rise again.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> in the resurrection at the last day.” </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="JHN.11.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content"> Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life.

Jesus displayed this reaction to the afflicted in Mark 1:43, Matt 9:30. Was he angry at the afflicted?

The Greek word used here for Jesus’ weeping (ἐδάκρυσεν, edakrusen) is different from the one used to describe the weeping of Mary and the Jews in v. 33 which indicated loud wailing and cries of lament. This word simply means “to shed tears” and has more the idea of quiet grief. But why did Jesus do this? Not out of grief for Lazarus, since he was about to be raised to life again. L. Morris (John [NICNT], 558) thinks it was grief over the misconception of those round about. But it seems that in the context the weeping is triggered by the thought of Lazarus in the tomb: This was not personal grief over the loss of a friend (since Lazarus was about to be restored to life) but grief over the effects of sin, death, and the realm of Satan. It was a natural complement to the previous emotional expression of anger (11:33). It is also possible that Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus because he knew there was also a tomb for himself ahead.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="JHN.11.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content"> Thus the people who had come to mourn</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the Judeans”; Grk “the Jews.” Here the phrase refers to the friends, acquaintances, and relatives of Lazarus or his sisters who had come to mourn, since the Jewish religious authorities are specifically mentioned as a separate group in John 11:46-47.
