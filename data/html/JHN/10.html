Some interpreters have suggested that there was more than one flock in the fold, and there would be a process of separation where each shepherd called out his own flock. This may also be suggested by the mention of a doorkeeper in v. 3 since only the larger sheepfolds would have such a guard. But the Gospel of John never mentions a distinction among the sheep in this fold; in fact (10:16) there are other sheep which are to be brought in, but they are to be one flock and one shepherd.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JHN.10.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> When he has brought all his own sheep</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “sheep” is not in the Greek text, but is implied.</span></span></span><span class="content"> out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “because they know.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> his voice. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JHN.10.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> They will never follow a stranger,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “someone whom they do not know.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> but will run away from him, because they do not recognize</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “know.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the stranger’s voice.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the voice of someone they do not know.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JHN.10.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Jesus told them this parable,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn A parable is a fairly short narrative that has symbolic meaning. The Greek word παροιμίαν (paroimian) is used again in 16:25, 29. This term does not occur in the synoptic gospels, where παραβολή (parabolh) is used. Nevertheless it is similar, denoting a short narrative with figurative or symbolic meaning.</span></span></span><span class="content"> but they</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “these.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> did not understand</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “comprehend.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> what he was saying to them.</span></span></div>

Acts 1:21; see also Num 27:17; 2 Chr 1:10]), it may well be that Jesus’ words here look forward to the new covenant community of believers. Another significant NT text is Luke 9:4, where both these verbs occur in the context of the safety and security provided by a given household for the disciples.

Note the contrast: The thief takes the life of the sheep (10:10), the good shepherd lays down his own life for the sheep. Jesus is not speaking generally here, but specifically: He has his own substitutionary death on the cross in view. For a literal shepherd with a literal flock, the shepherd’s death would have spelled disaster for the sheep; in this instance it spells life for them (Compare the worthless shepherd of Zech 11:17, by contrast).</span></span></span><span class="content"> for the sheep. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="JHN.10.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content"> The hired hand,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Jesus contrasts the behavior of the shepherd with that of the hired hand. This is a worker who is simply paid to do a job; he has no other interest in the sheep and is certainly not about to risk his life for them. When they are threatened, he simply runs away.</span></span></span><span class="content"> who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “leaves.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the sheep and runs away.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “flees.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> So the wolf attacks</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “seizes.” The more traditional rendering, “snatches,” has the idea of seizing something by force and carrying it off, which is certainly possible here.

Most likely it was added by a later scribe to improve the readability of vv. 12-13, which is one long sentence in Greek. It has been included in the translation for the same stylistic reasons.</span></span></span></span></div>

This recalls the mission of the Son in 3:16-17, which was to save the world – not just the nation of Israel.

(For further information see R. G. Bratcher, “‘The Jews’ in the Gospel of John,” BT 26 [1975]: 401-9.) Here the phrase could be taken to refer to the Jewish religious leaders, since the Pharisees were the last to be mentioned specifically by name, in John 9:40. However, in light of the charge about demon possession, which echoes 8:48, it is more likely that Jewish people in general (perhaps in Jerusalem, if that is understood to be the setting of the incident) are in view here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> because of these words. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="JHN.10.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content"> Many of them were saying, “He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind!</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “is insane.” To translate simply “he is mad” (so KJV, ASV, RSV; “raving mad” NIV) could give the impression that Jesus was angry, while the actual charge was madness or insanity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Why do you listen to him?” </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JHN.10.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content"> Others said, “These are not the words</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the sayings.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of someone possessed by a demon.

The word is thus connected with the consecration of all the houses of God in the history of the nation of Israel.sn The feast of the Dedication (also known as Hanukkah) was a feast celebrating annually the Maccabean victories of 165-164 b.c. – when Judas Maccabeus drove out the Syrians, rebuilt the altar, and rededicated the temple on 25 Kislev (1 Macc 4:41-61). From a historical standpoint, it was the last great deliverance the Jewish people had experienced, and it came at a time when least expected. Josephus ends his account of the institution of the festival with the following statement: “And from that time to the present we observe this festival, which we call the festival of Lights, giving this name to it, I think, from the fact that the right to worship appeared to us at a time when we hardly dared hope for it” (Ant. 12.7.6 [12.325]).</span></span></span><span class="content"> in Jerusalem.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">map For location see Map5-B1; Map6-F3; Map7-E2; Map8-F2; Map10-B3; JP1-F4; JP2-F4; JP3-F4; JP4-F4.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="JHN.10.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content"> It was winter,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn It was winter.

Technically the Psalms are not part of the OT “law” (which usually referred to the five books of Moses), but occasionally the term “law” was applied to the entire OT, as here. The problem in this verse concerns the meaning of Jesus’ quotation from Ps 82:6. It is important to look at the OT context: The whole line reads “I say, you are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you.” Jesus will pick up on the term “sons of the Most High” in 10:36, where he refers to himself as the Son of God. The psalm was understood in rabbinic circles as an attack on unjust judges who, though they have been given the title “gods” because of their quasi-divine function of exercising judgment, are just as mortal as other men. What is the argument here? It is often thought to be as follows: If it was an OT practice to refer to men like the judges as gods, and not blasphemy, why did the Jewish authorities object when this term was applied to Jesus? This really doesn’t seem to fit the context, however, since if that were the case Jesus would not be making any claim for “divinity” for himself over and above any other human being – and therefore he would not be subject to the charge of blasphemy. Rather, this is evidently a case of arguing from the lesser to the greater, a common form of rabbinic argument. The reason the OT judges could be called gods is because they were vehicles of the word of God (cf. 10:35). But granting that premise, Jesus deserves much more than they to be called God. He is the Word incarnate, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world to save the world (10:36). In light of the prologue to the Gospel of John, it seems this interpretation would have been most natural for the author. If it is permissible to call men “gods” because they were the vehicles of the word of God, how much more permissible is it to use the word “God” of him who is the Word of God?</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="JHN.10.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content"> If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The parenthetical note And the scripture cannot be broken belongs to Jesus’ words rather than the author’s. Not only does Jesus appeal to the OT to defend himself against the charge of blasphemy, but he also adds that the scripture cannot be “broken.” In this context he does not explain precisely what is meant by “broken,” but it is not too hard to determine. Jesus’ argument depended on the exact word used in the context of Ps 82:6. If any other word for “judge” had been used in the psalm, his argument would have been meaningless. Since the scriptures do use this word in Ps 82:6, the argument is binding, because they cannot be “broken” in the sense of being shown to be in error.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="JHN.10.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content"> do you say about the one whom the Father set apart</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “dedicated.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="JHN.10.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content"> If I do not perform</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “do.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the deeds</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “works.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> of my Father, do not believe me. </span></span><span class="verse v38" data-usfm="JHN.10.38"><span class="label">38</span><span class="content"> But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “works.”sn Jesus says that in the final analysis, the deeds he did should indicate whether he was truly from the Father.

Externally, the most viable readings are ἐζήτουν οὖν and ἐζήτουν. Transcriptionally, the οὖν could have dropped out via haplography since the verb ends in the same three letters. On the other hand, it is difficult to explain the readings with δέ or καί if ἐζήτουν οὖν is original; such readings would more likely have arisen from the simple ἐζήτουν. Intrinsically, John is fond of οὖν, using it some 200 times. Further, this Gospel begins relatively few sentences without some conjunction. The minimal support for the δέ and καί readings suggests that they arose either from the lone verb reading (which would thus be prior to their respective Vorlagen but not necessarily the earliest reading) or through carelessness on the part of the scribes. Indeed, the ancestors of Ì45 and D may have committed haplography, leaving later scribes in the chain to guess at the conjunction needed. In sum, the best reading appears to be ἐζήτουν οὖν.</span></span></span><span class="content"> they attempted</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “they were seeking.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he departed out of their hand.”sn It is not clear whether the authorities simply sought to “arrest” him, or were renewing their attempt to stone him (cf. John 10:31) by seizing him and taking him out to be stoned. In either event, Jesus escaped their clutches. Nor is it clear whether Jesus’ escape is to be understood as a miracle. If so, the text gives little indication and even less description. What is clear is that until his “hour” comes, Jesus is completely safe from the hands of men: His enemies are powerless to touch him until they are permitted to do so.</span></span></span></span></div>
