J. A. Hort (The New Testament in the Original Greek, vol. 2, Introduction; Appendix, 87-88), that the backdrop of 8:12 is the lighting of the candelabra in the court of women, may offer a plausible setting to the proclamation by Jesus that he is the light of the world. The last time that Jesus spoke in the narrative (assuming 7:53-8:11 is not part of the original text, as the textual evidence suggests) is in 7:38, where he was speaking to a crowd of pilgrims in the temple area. This is where he is found in the present verse, and he may be addressing the crowd again. Jesus’ remark has to be seen in view of both the prologue (John 1:4, 5) and the end of the discourse with Nicodemus (John 3:19-21). The coming of Jesus into the world provokes judgment: A choosing up of sides becomes necessary. The one who comes to the light, that is, who follows Jesus, will not walk in the darkness. The one who refuses to come, will walk in the darkness. In this contrast, there are only two alternatives. So it is with a person’s decision about Jesus. Furthermore, this serves as in implicit indictment of Jesus’ opponents, who still walk in the darkness, because they refuse to come to him. This sets up the contrast in chap. 9 between the man born blind, who receives both physical and spiritual sight, and the Pharisees (John 9:13, 15, 16) who have physical sight but remain in spiritual darkness.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The one who follows me will never</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The double negative οὐ μή (ou mh) is emphatic in 1st century Hellenistic Greek.</span></span></span><span class="content"> walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="JHN.8.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content"> So the Pharisees</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn See the note on Pharisees in 1:24.</span></span></span><span class="content"> objected,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Then the Pharisees said to him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true!”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Compare the charge You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true! to Jesus’ own statement about his testimony in 5:31.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="JHN.8.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content"> Jesus answered,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Jesus answered and said to them.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I am going.

The ignorance of the religious authorities regarding Jesus’ origin works on two levels at once: First, they thought Jesus came from Galilee (although he really came from Bethlehem in Judea) and second, they did not know that he came from heaven (from the Father), and this is where he would return. See further John 7:52.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="JHN.8.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content"> You people</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “people” is supplied in the translation to indicate that the pronoun and verb (“judge”) in Greek are plural.</span></span></span><span class="content"> judge by outward appearances;</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “judge according to external things”; Grk “according to the flesh.” These translations are given by BDAG 916 s.v. σάρξ 5.</span></span></span><span class="content"> I do not judge anyone.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn What is the meaning of Jesus’ statement “I do not judge anyone”? It is clear that Jesus did judge (even in the next verse). The point is that he didn’t practice the same kind of judgment that the Pharisees did. Their kind of judgment was condemnatory. They tried to condemn people. Jesus did not come to judge the world, but to save it (3:17). Nevertheless, and not contradictory to this, the coming of Jesus did bring judgment, because it forced people to make a choice. Would they accept Jesus or reject him? Would they come to the light or shrink back into the darkness? As they responded, so were they judged – just as 3:19-21 previously stated. One’s response to Jesus determines one’s eternal destiny.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JHN.8.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> But if I judge, my evaluation is accurate,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “my judgment is true.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> because I am not alone when I judge,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “when I judge” is not in the Greek text, but is implied by the context.</span></span></span><span class="content"> but I and the Father who sent me do so together.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The phrase “do so together” is not in the Greek text, but is implied by the context.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JHN.8.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> It is written in your law that </span><span class="it"><span class="content">the testimony of two men is true</span></span><span class="content">.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn An allusion to Deut 17:6.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JHN.8.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> I testify about myself</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “I am the one who testifies about myself.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”</span></span></div>

Acc. to Mishnah, Shekalim 6, 5 there were in the temple 13 such receptacles in the form of trumpets.

Here the phrase refers to the Jewish people in Jerusalem who had been listening to Jesus’ teaching in the temple and had believed his claim to be the Messiah, hence, “those Judeans who had believed him.” The term “Judeans” is preferred here to the more general “people” because the debate concerns descent from Abraham (v. 33).</span></span></span><span class="content"> who had believed him, “If you continue to follow my teaching,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “If you continue in my word.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> you are really</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “truly.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> my disciples </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="JHN.8.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content"> and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the truth will release you.” The translation “set you free” or “release you” (unlike the more traditional “make you free”) conveys more the idea that the hearers were currently in a state of slavery from which they needed to be freed. The following context supports precisely this idea.sn The statement the truth will set you free is often taken as referring to truth in the philosophical (or absolute) sense, or in the intellectual sense, or even (as the Jews apparently took it) in the political sense. In the context of John’s Gospel (particularly in light of the prologue) this must refer to truth about the person and work of Jesus. It is saving truth. As L. Morris says, “it is the truth which saves men from the darkness of sin, not that which saves them from the darkness of error (though there is a sense in which men in Christ are delivered from gross error)” (John [NICNT], 457).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="JHN.8.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content"> “We are descendants</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “We are the seed” (an idiom).</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Abraham,” they replied,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “They answered to him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “and have never been anyone’s slaves!

Here repeated, continuous action is in view. The one whose lifestyle is characterized by repeated, continuous sin is a slave to sin. That one is not free; sin has enslaved him. To break free from this bondage requires outside (divine) intervention. Although the statement is true at the general level (the person who continually practices a lifestyle of sin is enslaved to sin) the particular sin of the Jewish authorities, repeatedly emphasized in the Fourth Gospel, is the sin of unbelief. The present tense in this instance looks at the continuing refusal on the part of the Jewish leaders to acknowledge who Jesus is, in spite of mounting evidence.</span></span></span><span class="content"> sin is a slave</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on the word “slaves” in 4:51.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of sin. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="JHN.8.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content"> The slave does not remain in the family</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “household.” The Greek work οἰκία (oikia) can denote the family as consisting of relatives by both descent and marriage, as well as slaves and servants, living in the same house (more the concept of an “extended family”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> forever, but the son remains forever.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Jesus’ point is that while a slave may be part of a family or household, the slave is not guaranteed a permanent place there, while a son, as a descendant or blood relative, will always be guaranteed a place in the family (remains forever).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="JHN.8.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content"> So if the son</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “Son.” The question is whether “son” is to be understood as a direct reference to Jesus himself, or as an indirect reference (a continuation of the generic illustration begun in the previous verse).</span></span></span><span class="content"> sets you free, you will be really free. </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="JHN.8.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content"> I know that you are Abraham’s descendants.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “seed” (an idiom).</span></span></span><span class="content"> But you want</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “you are seeking.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> to kill me, because my teaching</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “my word.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> makes no progress among you.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “finds no place in you.” The basic idea seems to be something (in this case Jesus’ teaching) making headway or progress where resistance is involved.

However, these mss do not agree on the placement of the pronoun: τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν ποιεῖτε (tou patro&quot; Jumwn poieite), τῷ πατρὶ ὑμῶν (tw patri Jumwn), and τῷ πατρὶ ὑμῶν ταῦτα (tw patri Jumwn tauta) all occur. If the pronoun is read, then the devil is in view and the text should be translated as “you are practicing the things you have heard from your father.” If it is not read, then the same Father mentioned in the first part of the verse is in view. In this case, ποιεῖτε should be taken as an imperative: “you [must] practice the things you have heard from the Father.” The omission is decidedly the harder reading, both because the contrast between God and the devil is now delayed until v. 41, and because ποιεῖτε could be read as an indicative, especially since the two clauses are joined by καί (kai, “and”). Thus, the pronoun looks to be a motivated reading. In light of the better external and internal evidence the omission is preferred.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Father!”</span></span></div>

The use of past tenses would seem to refer to something that occurred during the patriarch’s lifetime. Genesis Rabbah 44:25ff, (cf. 59:6) states that Rabbi Akiba, in a debate with Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, held that Abraham had been shown not this world only but the world to come (this would include the days of the Messiah). More realistically, it is likely that Gen 22:13-15 lies behind Jesus’ words. This passage, known to rabbis as the Akedah (“Binding”), tells of Abraham finding the ram which will replace his son Isaac on the altar of sacrifice – an occasion of certain rejoicing.</span></span></span></span></div>

The wording is similar to two other texts: Luke 4:30 (διελθὼν διὰ μέσου; in several mss αὐτῶν ἐπορεύετο καί [autwn eporeueto kai] is found between this phrase and παρῆγεν, strengthening the parallel with Luke 4:30) and John 9:1 (παρῆγεν; cf. παράγων [paragwn] there). The effect is to signal Jesus’ departure as a miraculous cloaking. As such, the additional statement has all the earmarks of scribal amplification. Further, the best and earliest witnesses (Ì66,75 א* B D W Θ* lat sa) lack these words, rendering the shorter text virtually certain.tn Grk “from the temple.”</span></span></span></span></div>
