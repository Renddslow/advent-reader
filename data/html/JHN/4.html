As significant as this external support is, the internal evidence seems to be on the side of ᾿Ιησοῦς. “Jesus” is mentioned two more times in the first two verses of chapter four in a way that is stylistically awkward (so much so that the translation has substituted the pronoun for the first one; see tn note below). This seems to be sufficient reason to motivate scribes to change the wording to κύριος. Further, the reading ᾿Ιησοῦς is not without decent support, though admittedly not as strong as that for κύριος (Ì66* א D Θ 086 Ë1 565 1241 al lat bo). On the other hand, this Gospel speaks of Jesus as Lord in the evangelist’s narrative descriptions elsewhere only in 11:2; 20:18, 20; 21:12; and probably 6:23, preferring ᾿Ιησοῦς most of the time. This fact could be used to argue that scribes, acquainted with John’s style, changed κύριος to ᾿Ιησοῦς. But the immediate context generally is weighed more heavily than an author’s style. It is possible that neither word was in the original text and scribes supplied what they thought most appropriate (see TCGNT 176). But without ms evidence to this effect coupled with the harder reading ᾿Ιησοῦς, this conjecture must remain doubtful. All in all, it is best to regard ᾿Ιησοῦς as the original reading here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> knew that the Pharisees</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn See the note on Pharisees in 1:24.</span></span></span><span class="content"> had heard that he</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Jesus”; the repetition of the proper name is somewhat redundant in English (see the beginning of the verse) and so the pronoun (“he”) has been substituted here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> was winning</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “was making.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and baptizing more disciples than John </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="JHN.4.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn This is a parenthetical note by the author.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JHN.4.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> he left Judea and set out once more for Galilee.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The author doesn’t tell why Jesus chose to set out once more for Galilee.

There was theological opposition between the Samaritans and the Jews because the former refused to worship in Jerusalem. After the exile the Samaritans put obstacles in the way of the Jewish restoration of Jerusalem, and in the 2nd century b.c. the Samaritans helped the Syrians in their wars against the Jews. In 128 b.c. the Jewish high priest retaliated and burned the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JHN.4.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> Now he came to a Samaritan town</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “town of Samaria.” The noun Σαμαρείας (Samareias) has been translated as an attributive genitive.</span></span></span><span class="content"> called Sychar,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Sychar was somewhere in the vicinity of Shechem, possibly the village of Askar, 1.5 km northeast of Jacob’s well.</span></span></span><span class="content"> near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn Perhaps referred to in Gen 48:22.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JHN.4.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, since he was tired from the journey, sat right down beside</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “on (ἐπί, epi) the well.” There may have been a low stone rim encircling the well, or the reading of Ì66 (“on the ground”) may be correct.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the well.

It is possible that no explicit subject was in the original text and scribes added either ἡ γυνή or ἐκείνη to make the meaning clear. It is also possible that the archetype of Ì75 א B expunged the subject because it was not altogether necessary, with the scribe of א later adding the pronoun. However, ἡ γυνή is not in doubt in any other introduction to the woman’s words in this chapter (cf. vv. 9, 15, 17, 19, 25), suggesting that intentional deletion was not the motive for the shorter reading in v. 11 (or else why would they delete the words only here?). Thus, the fact that virtually all witnesses (Ì66 א2 A C D L Ws Θ Ψ 050 083 086 Ë1,13 Ï latt syc,p,h sa bo) have ἡ γυνή here may suggest that it is a motivated reading, conforming this verse to the rest of the pericope. Although a decision is difficult, it is probably best to regard the shorter reading as authentic. NA27 has ἡ γυνή in brackets, indicating doubts as to their authenticity.

The last part of v. 45 is a parenthetical note by the author. The major problem in these verses concerns the contradiction between the proverb stated by Jesus in v. 44 and the reception of the Galileans in v. 45. Origen solved the problem by referring his own country to Judea (which Jesus had just left) and not Galilee. But this runs counter to the thrust of John’s Gospel, which takes pains to identify Jesus with Galilee (cf. 1:46) and does not even mention his Judean birth. R. E. Brown typifies the contemporary approach: He regards v. 44 as an addition by a later redactor who wanted to emphasize Jesus’ unsatisfactory reception in Galilee. Neither expedient is necessary, though, if honor is understood in its sense of attributing true worth to someone. The Galileans did welcome him, but their welcome was to prove a superficial response based on what they had seen him do at the feast. There is no indication that the signs they saw brought them to place their faith in Jesus any more than Nicodemus did on the basis of the signs. But a superficial welcome based on enthusiasm for miracles is no real honor at all.</span></span></span></span></div>
