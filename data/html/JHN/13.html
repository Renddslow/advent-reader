All of John 13:1 is a single sentence in Greek, although in English this would be unacceptably awkward. At the end of the verse the idiom εἰς τέλος (eis telos) was translated literally as “to the end” and the modern equivalents given in the note above, because there is an important lexical link between this passage and John 19:30, τετέλεσται (tetelestai, “It is ended”). sn The full extent of Jesus’ love for his disciples is not merely seen in his humble service to them in washing their feet (the most common interpretation of the passage). The full extent of his love for them is demonstrated in his sacrificial death for them on the cross. The footwashing episode which follows then becomes a prophetic act, or acting out beforehand, of his upcoming death on their behalf. The message for the disciples was that they were to love one another not just in humble, self-effacing service, but were to be willing to die for one another. At least one of them got this message eventually, though none understood it at the time (see 1 John 3:16).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="JHN.13.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content"> The evening meal</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “Supper.” To avoid possible confusion because of different regional English usage regarding the distinction between “dinner” and “supper” as an evening meal, the translation simply refers to “the evening meal.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> was in progress, and the devil had already put into the heart</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn At this point the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Jesus. C. K. Barrett (St. John, 365) thought this was a reference to the idea entering the devil’s own heart, but this does not seem likely. It is more probable that Judas’ heart is meant, since the use of the Greek article (rather than a possessive pronoun) is a typical idiom when a part of one’s own body is indicated. Judas’ name is withheld until the end of the sentence for dramatic effect (emphasis). This action must be read in light of 13:27, and appears to refer to a preliminary idea or plan.</span></span></span><span class="content"> of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “that he should hand over.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Jesus.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “betray him”; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JHN.13.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> Because Jesus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Because he knew”; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> knew that the Father had handed all things over to him,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “had given all things into his hands.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> and that he had come from God and was going back to God, </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JHN.13.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> he got up from the meal, removed</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “and removed”; the conjunction καί (kai, “and”) has been left untranslated here for improved English style.</span></span></span><span class="content"> his outer clothes,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The plural τὰ ἱμάτια (ta Jimatia) is probably a reference to more than one garment (cf.

The term λέντιον is a Latin loanword (linteum) which is also found in the rabbinic literature (see BDAG 592 s.v.). It would have been a long piece of linen cloth, long enough for Jesus to have wrapped it about his waist and still used the free end to wipe the disciples’ feet.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JHN.13.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “with the towel with which he was girded.”</span></span></span></span></div>

A common understanding is that the “bath” Jesus referred to is the initial cleansing from sin, which necessitates only “lesser, partial” cleansings from sins after conversion. This makes a fine illustration from a homiletic standpoint, but is it the meaning of the passage? This seems highly doubtful. Jesus stated that the disciples were completely clean except for Judas (vv. 10b, 11). What they needed was to have their feet washed by Jesus. In the broader context of the Fourth Gospel, the significance of the foot-washing seems to point not just to an example of humble service (as most understand it), but something more – Jesus’ self-sacrificial death on the cross. If this is correct, then the foot-washing which they needed to undergo represented their acceptance of this act of self-sacrifice on the part of their master. This makes Peter’s initial abhorrence of the act of humiliation by his master all the more significant in context; it also explains Jesus’ seemingly harsh reply to Peter (above, v. 8; compare Matt 16:21-23 where Jesus says to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> And you disciples</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “disciples” is supplied in English to clarify the plural Greek pronoun and verb.

Jesus tells his disciples after he has finished washing their feet that what he has done is to set an example for them. In the previous verse he told them they were to wash one another’s feet. What is the point of the example? If it is simply an act of humble service, as most interpret the significance, then Jesus is really telling his disciples to serve one another in humility rather than seeking preeminence over one another. If, however, the example is one of self-sacrifice up to the point of death, then Jesus is telling them to lay down their lives for one another (cf. 15:13).</span></span></span><span class="content"> – you should do just as I have done for you. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JHN.13.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> I tell you the solemn truth,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Truly, truly, I say to you.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> the slave</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn See the note on the word “slaves” in 4:51.</span></span></span><span class="content"> is not greater than his master, nor is the one who is sent as a messenger</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “nor is the apostle” (“apostle” means “one who is sent” in Greek).</span></span></span><span class="content"> greater than the one who sent him. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JHN.13.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> If you understand</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “If you know.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</span></span></div>

This individual also is mentioned in 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, and 21:20. Some have suggested that this disciple is to be identified with Lazarus, since the Fourth Gospel specifically states that Jesus loved him (11:3, 5, 36). From the terminology alone this is a possibility; the author is certainly capable of using language in this way to indicate connections. But there is nothing else to indicate that Lazarus was present at the last supper; Mark 14:17 seems to indicate it was only the twelve who were with Jesus at this time, and there is no indication in the Fourth Gospel to the contrary. Nor does it appear that Lazarus ever stood so close to Jesus as the later references in chaps. 19, 20 and 21 seem to indicate. When this is coupled with the omission of all references to John son of Zebedee from the Fourth Gospel, it seems far more likely that the references to the beloved disciple should be understood as references to him.</span></span></span><span class="content"> was at the table</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “was reclining.” This reflects the normal 1st century practice of eating a meal in a semi-reclining position.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to the right of Jesus in a place of honor.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “was reclining in the bosom (or “lap”) of Jesus” (according to both L&amp;N 17.25 and BDAG 65 s.v. ἀνάκειμαι 2 an idiom for taking the place of honor at a meal, but note the similar expression in John 1:18). Whether this position or the position to the left of Jesus should be regarded as the position of second highest honor (next to the host, in this case Jesus, who was in the position of highest honor) is debated. F. Prat, “Les places d’honneur chez les Juifs contemporains du Christ” (RSR 15 [1925]: 512-22), who argued that the table arrangement was that of the Roman triclinium (a U-shaped table with Jesus and two other disciples at the bottom of the U), considered the position to the left of Jesus to be the one of second highest honor. Thus the present translation renders this “a position of honor” without specifying which one (since both of the two disciples to the right and to the left of Jesus would be in positions of honor). Other translations differ as to how they handle the phrase ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ τοῦ ᾿Ιησοῦ (en tw kolpw tou Ihsou; “leaning on Jesus’ bosom,” KJV; “lying close to the breast of Jesus,” RSV; “reclining on Jesus’ breast,” NASB; “reclining next to him,” NIV, NRSV) but the symbolic significance of the beloved disciple’s position seems clear. He is close to Jesus and in an honored position. The phrase as an idiom for a place of honor at a feast is attested in the Epistles of Pliny (the Younger) 4.22.4, an approximate contemporary of Paul.sn Note that the same expression translated in a place of honor here (Grk “in the bosom of”) is used to indicate Jesus’ relationship with the Father in 1:18.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="JHN.13.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content"> So Simon Peter</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn It is not clear where Simon Peter was seated.

It is entirely possible that Judas was seated to Jesus’ left. Matt 26:25 seems to indicate that Jesus could speak to him without being overheard by the rest of the group.

Luke 22:3 uses the same terminology of Satan “entering into” Judas but indicates it happened before the last supper at the time Judas made his deal with the authorities. This is not necessarily irreconcilable with John’s account, however, because John 13:2 makes it clear that Judas had already come under satanic influence prior to the meal itself. The statement here is probably meant to indicate that Judas at this point came under the influence of Satan even more completely and finally. It marks the end of a process which, as Luke indicates, had begun earlier.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Jesus said to him,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “Then Jesus said to him.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> “What you are about to do, do quickly.” </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="JHN.13.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content"> (Now none of those present at the table</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “reclining at the table.” The phrase reclining at the table reflects the normal practice in 1st century Near Eastern culture of eating a meal in a semi-reclining position.</span></span></span><span class="content"> understood</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “knew.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> why Jesus</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “he”; the referent (Jesus) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said this to Judas.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “to him”; the referent (Judas) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="JHN.13.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content"> Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “telling him, ‘Buy whatever we need for the feast.’” The first clause is direct discourse and the second clause indirect discourse.

With the departure of Judas to set in motion the betrayal, arrest, trials, crucifixion, and death of Jesus, daytime is over and night has come (see John 9:5; 11:9-10; 12:35-36). Judas had become one of those who walked by night and stumbled, because the light was not in him (11:10).</span></span></span></span></div>

Although the mss that omit the words are significantly better witnesses, the omission may have occurred because of an error of sight due to homoioteleuton (v. 31 ends in ἐν αὐτῷ [en autw, “in him”], as does this clause). Further, the typical step-parallelism found in John is retained if the clause is kept intact (TCGNT 205-6). At the same time, it is difficult to explain how such a wide variety of witnesses would have accidentally deleted this clause, and arguments for intentional deletion are not particularly convincing. NA27 rightly places the words in brackets, indicating doubt as to their authenticity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him right away.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “immediately.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="JHN.13.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content"> Children, I am still with you for a little while.

In the OT the ten commandments have a setting in the covenant between God and Israel at Sinai; they were the stipulations that Israel had to observe if the nation were to be God’s chosen people. In speaking of love as the new commandment for those whom Jesus had chosen as his own (John 13:1, 15:16) and as a mark by which they could be distinguished from others (13:35), John shows that he is thinking of this scene in covenant terminology. But note that the disciples are to love “Just as I have loved you” (13:34). The love Jesus has for his followers cannot be duplicated by them in one sense, because it effects their salvation, since he lays down his life for them: It is an act of love that gives life to people. But in another sense, they can follow his example (recall to the end, 13:1; also 1 John 3:16, 4:16 and the interpretation of Jesus’ washing of the disciples’ feet). In this way Jesus’ disciples are to love one another: They are to follow his example of sacrificial service to one another, to death if necessary.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="JHN.13.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content"> Everyone</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Grk “All people,” although many modern translations have rendered πάντες (pantes) as “all men” (ASV, RSV, NASB, NIV).
