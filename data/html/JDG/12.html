The words כִּי אָמְרוּ פְּלִיטֵי אֶפְרַיִם (ki ’amru pÿlitey ’efrayim, “because they said, ‘Refugees of Ephraim’”) may have been accidentally copied from the next verse (cf. כִּי יֹאמְרוּ פְּלִיטֵי אֶפְרַיִם, ki yo’mÿru pelitey ’efrayim) and the following words (“you, O Gilead…Manasseh”) then added in an attempt to make sense of the verse. See G. F. Moore, Judges (ICC), 307-8, and C. F. Burney, Judges, 327. If the Hebrew text is retained, then the Ephraimites appear to be insulting the Gileadites by describing them as refugees who are squatting on Ephraim’s and Manasseh’s land. The present translation assumes that “Ephraim” is a genitive of location after “refugees.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JDG.12.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content"> The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan River</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The word “River” is not in the Hebrew text, but is supplied in the translation for clarification.</span></span></span><span class="content"> opposite Ephraim.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “against Ephraim,” that is, so as to prevent Ephraim from crossing.</span></span></span><span class="content"> Whenever an Ephraimite fugitive</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew text has a plural form here.</span></span></span><span class="content"> said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “say to.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JDG.12.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> then they said to him, “Say ‘Shibboleth!’”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">sn The inability of the Ephraimites to pronounce the word shibboleth the way the Gileadites did served as an identifying test.
