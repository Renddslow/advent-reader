When they approached…” Verse 6b states that Samson did not tell his parents about his encounter with the lion (vv. 5b-6a), but v. 5a gives the impression they would have seen the entire episode. One could assume that Samson separated from his parents prior to the lion’s attack, but the Hebrew text does not indicate this. It seems more likely that the words “with his father and his mother” were accidentally copied into the text, perhaps under the influence of v. 4a, where the same phrase appears. An original singular verb (“he approached”) may have been changed to the plural form (“they approached”) after the words “his father and his mother” were accidentally added to the text.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the vineyards of Timnah, he saw a roaring young lion attacking him.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and look, a young lion of the lions was roaring to meet him.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JDG.14.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s spirit empowered</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “rushed on.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> him and he tore the lion</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “him” or “it”; the referent (the lion) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> in two with his bare hands</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “and there was nothing in his hand.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> as easily as one would tear a young goat.

Seeing and tasting the honey appears to encourage Manoah to go with his son to Timnah. Perhaps both Samson and his father viewed the honey as a good omen of future blessing. Possibly Samson considered it a symbol of sexual pleasure or an aphrodisiac. Note the use of honey imagery in Song 4:11 and 5:1.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to his father and mother, he offered them some and they ate it.

Another option is to change שְׁלֹשֶׁת (shÿloshet, “three”) at the end of v. 14 to שֵׁשֶׁת (sheshet, “six”), but the resulting scenario does not account as well for v. 17, which implies the bride had been hounding Samson for more than one day.</span></span></span><span class="content"> day they said to Samson’s bride, “Trick your husband into giving the solution to the riddle.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Entice your husband so that he might tell us the riddle.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> If you refuse,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “lest.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> we will burn up</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew text expands the statement: “burn up with fire.” The words “with fire” are redundant in English and have been omitted from the translation for stylistic reasons.</span></span></span><span class="content"> you and your father’s family.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “house.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> Did you invite us here</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tc The translation assumes the Hebrew form הֲלֹם (halom, “here,” attested in five Hebrew mss and supported by the Targum), instead of the inexplicable הֲלֹא (halo’), a negative particle with interrogative particle prefixed to it.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to make us poor?”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn For discussion of this difficult form, see C.
