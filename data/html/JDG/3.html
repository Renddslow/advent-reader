The Hebrew text reads literally, “only in order that the generations of the Israelites might know, to teach them war – only those who formerly did not know them.”sn The stated purpose for leaving the nations (to teach the subsequent generations…how to conduct holy war) seems to contradict 2:22 and 3:4, which indicate the nations were left to test Israel’s loyalty to the Lord. However, the two stated purposes can be harmonized. The willingness of later generations to learn and engage in holy war would measure their allegiance to the Lord (see B. G. Webb, Judges [JSOTSup], 114-15).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JDG.3.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> These were the nations:</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The words “These were the nations,” though not present in the Hebrew text, are supplied in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> the five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo-Hamath.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “the entrance to Hamath.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JDG.3.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> They were left to test Israel, so the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> would know if his people would obey the commands he gave their ancestors through Moses.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “to know if they would hear the commands of the Lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span></div>

See Judg 20:16, where 700 Benjaminites are described in this way. Perhaps the Benjaminites purposely trained several of their young men to be left-handed warriors by restricting the use of the right hand from an early age so the left hand would become dominant. Left-handed men would have a distinct military advantage, especially when attacking city gates. See B. Halpern, “The Assassination of Eglon: The First Locked-Room Murder Mystery,” BRev 4 (1988): 35.</span></span></span><span class="content"> The Israelites sent him to King Eglon of Moab with their tribute payment.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “The Israelites sent by his hand an offering to Eglon, king of Moab.”</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JDG.3.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content"> Ehud made himself a sword – it had two edges and was eighteen inches long.</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew term גֹּמֶד (gomed) denotes a unit of linear measure, perhaps a cubit (the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger – approximately 18 inches [45 cm]).

The noun has the article prefixed and directive suffix. The word may be a technical architectural term, indicating the area into which Ehud moved as he left the king and began his escape. In this case Ehud is the subject of the verb “went out.” The present translation omits the clause, understanding it as an ancient variant of the first clause in v. 23. Some take the noun as “back,” understand “sword” (from the preceding clause) as the subject, and translate “the sword came out his [i.e., Eglon’s] back.” But this rendering is unlikely since the Hebrew word for “sword” (חֶרֶב, kherev) is feminine and the verb form translated “came out” (וַיֵּצֵא, vayyetse’) is masculine. (One expects agreement in gender when the subject is supplied from the preceding clause. See Ezek 33:4, 6.) See B. Lindars, Judges 1-5, 146-48, for discussion of the options.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="JDG.3.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content"> As Ehud went out into the vestibule,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Again the precise meaning of the Hebrew word, used only here in the OT, is uncertain. Since it is preceded by the verb “went out” and the next clause refers to Ehud closing doors, the noun is probably an architectural term referring to the room (perhaps a vestibule; see HALOT 604 s.v. מִסְדְּרוֹן) immediately outside the king’s upper chamber.
