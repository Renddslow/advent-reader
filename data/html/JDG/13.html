According to this interpretation, in v. 5 the angel reveals the truth to her – actually she has recently conceived and is now pregnant (see the translation in R. G. Boling, Judges [AB], 217). Usage favors this interpretation. The predicate adjective הָרָה (harah, “[be/become] pregnant”) elsewhere has a past (1 Sam 4:19) or present (Gen 16:11; 38:25; 2 Sam 11:5) translation value. (The usage in Isa 7:14 is debated, but a present translation is definitely possible there.) A final, but less likely possibility, is that she miraculously conceived during the angel’s speech, sometime between his statements recorded in vv. 3 and 5.</span></span></span><span class="content"> You must never cut his hair,</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “a razor should not go up on his head.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> for the child will be dedicated to God</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Or “set apart to God.” Traditionally the Hebrew term נָזִיר (nazir) has been translated “Nazirite.” The word is derived from the verb נָזַר (nazar, “to dedicate; to consecrate; to set apart”).</span></span></span><span class="content"> from birth.

Manoah should have known from these words that the messenger represented the Lord. In the preceding narrative the narrator has informed the reader that the visitor is the Lord’s messenger, but Manoah and his wife did not perceive this. In vv. 5 and 7 the angel refers to “God” (אֱלֹהִים, ’elohim), not the Lord (יְהוַה, yÿhvah). Manoah’s wife calls the visitor “a man sent from God” and “God’s messenger” (v. 6), while Manoah prays to the “Lord” (אֲדוֹנָי, ’adonay) and calls the visitor “a man sent from God” (v. 8).</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JDG.13.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content"> Manoah said to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s messenger, “Tell us your name, so we can honor you when your announcement comes true.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Who your name?

He starts to say, “Who are you?” But then he switches to “your name” as if he began the sentence with “what.” See R. G. Boling, Judges (AB), 222.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JDG.13.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content"> The </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s messenger said to him, “You should not ask me my name, because you cannot comprehend it.”</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “Why do you ask for my name, for it is incomprehensible?” The Hebrew adjective פִּלְאִי (pile’iy, “wonderful, incomprehensible”) refers to what is in a category of its own and is beyond full human understanding.

The translation assumes that the phrase “the Lord’s messenger” was lost by homoioteleuton. If the text originally read לַיהוָה מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה (layhavah mal’akh yÿhvah), the scribe’s eye could have jumped from the first יְהוָה to the second, accidentally omitting two of the three words. Later the conjunction וּ (shureq) would have been added to the following מַפְלִא (mafli’) for syntactical reasons. Another possibility is that a pronominal subject (הוּא, hu’) has been lost in the MT due to haplography.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="JDG.13.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content"> As the flame went up from the altar toward the sky, the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">’s messenger went up in it</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “in the flame from the altar.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> while Manoah and his wife watched.

Of course, he may be exaggerating for the sake of emphasis. Another option, the one followed in the translation, understands Manoah to be referring to a lesser deity. The term אֱלֹהִים (’elohim) is sometimes used of an individual deity other than the Lord (see BDB 43 s.v. 2.a).
