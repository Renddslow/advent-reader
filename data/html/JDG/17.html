But v. 4 indicates that she did not give the money back to her son. Unless the statement is spoken by the woman to the <span class="nd">Lord</span>, it appears to be misplaced and fits much better in v. 2. It may have been accidentally omitted from a manuscript, written in the margin, and then later inserted in the wrong place in another manuscript.</span></span></span><span class="content"> His mother said, “May the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> reward</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Traditionally, “bless.”</span></span></span><span class="content"> you, my son!” </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JDG.17.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content"> When he gave back to his mother the eleven hundred pieces of silver, his mother said, “I solemnly dedicate</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “dedicating, I dedicate.” In this case the emphatic infinitive absolute lends a mood of solemnity to the statement.</span></span></span><span class="content"> this silver to the </span><span class="sc"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">.

Verses 4-6 indicate she took back the money and used a portion of it to hire a silversmith to make an idol for her son to use. The phrase “a carved image and cast metal image” is best taken as referring to two idols (see 18:17-18), even though the verb at the end of v. 4, וַיְהִי (vayÿhi, “and it was [in the house of Micah]”), is singular.</span></span></span><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JDG.17.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content"> When he gave the silver back to his mother, she</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn Heb “his mother.” The pronoun (“she”) has been substituted for the noun (“mother”) in the translation because of English style.</span></span></span><span class="content"> took two hundred pieces of silver</span><span class="note f"><span class="label">#</span><span class=" body"><span class="ft">tn The Hebrew text has “and gave it.” The referent (the pieces of silver) has been specified in the translation for clarity.</span></span></span><span class="content"> to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a metal image.

(See R. G. Boling, Judges [AB], 257; also Gen 45:8, where Joseph, who was a diviner and interpreter of dreams, is called Pharaoh’s “father,” and 2 Kgs 6:21; 13:14, where a prophet is referred to as a “father.” Note also 2 Kgs 8:9, where a king identifies himself as a prophet’s “son.” One of a prophet’s main functions was to communicate divine oracles. Cf. 2 Kgs 8:9ff.; 13:14-19).</span></span></span><span class="content"> and priest.
